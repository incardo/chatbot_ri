Foreword

The International Monetary Fund since its inception has had a compelling interest in
developing and promulgating guidelines for the compilation of consistent, sound, and
timely balance of payments statistics. This work underpins the IMF’s other responsi-
bilities, including conducting surveillance of countries’ economic policies and providing
financial assistance that enables countries to overcome short-term balance of payments
difficulties. Such guidelines, which have evolved to meet changing circumstances, have
been embodied in successive editions of the Balance of Payments Manual (the Manual )
since the first edition was published in 1948.
I am pleased to introduce the sixth edition of the Manual , which addresses the many
important developments that have occurred in the international economy since the fifth
edition was released. The fifth edition of the Manual , released in 1993, for the first time
addressed the important area of international investment position statistics. The sixth edi-
tion builds on the growing interest in examining vulnerabilities using balance sheet data,
as reflected in the addition of international investment position to the title, and extensive
elaboration of balance sheet components. The Manual also takes into account develop-
ments in globalization, for example, currency unions, cross-border production processes,
complex international company structures, and issues associated with international labor
mobility, such as remittances. In addition, it deals with developments in financial markets
by including updated treatments and elaborations on a range of issues, such as securitiza-
tion and special purpose entities.
Because of the important relationship between external and domestic economic devel-
opments, the Manual was revised in parallel with the update of the System of National
Accounts 2008. To support consistency and interlinkages among different macroeco-
nomic statistics, this edition of the Manual deepens the harmonization with the System of
National Accounts and the IMF’s manuals on government finance and on monetary and
financial statistics.
The revised Manual has been prepared by the IMF’s Statistics Department in close
consultation with the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics, which includes
experts from a range of member countries as well as international and regional organiza-
tions. In addition, input was received from specialized expert groups, and from member
countries and international organizations during regional seminars and public comment
periods on successive drafts of the Manual. In total, representatives from virtually all IMF
member countries participated in one or more of these initiatives. The process underly-
ing the revision of the Manual demonstrates the spirit of international collaboration and
cooperation, and I would like to commend all of the national and international experts
involved for their invaluable assistance.
I would like to recommend the Manual to compilers and users. I urge member countries to
adopt the guidelines of the sixth edition as their basis for compiling balance of payments and
international investment position statistics and for reporting this information to the IMF.

Preface

Introduction
1. The release of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Invest-
ment Position Manual ( BPM6 ) is the culmination of several years of work by the IMF
Statistics Department and the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics (the
Committee) in collaboration with compilers and other interested parties worldwide. It
updates the fifth edition published in 1993, providing guidance to IMF member countries
on the compilation of balance of payments and international investment position data.
2. When the Committee decided in 2001 to initiate an update of the manual, it con-
sidered that, while the overall framework of the fifth edition ( BPM5 ) remained adequate,
it needed to incorporate the numerous elaborations, clarifications, and improvements
and updates in methodology that had been identified since 1993, and to strengthen the
theoretical foundations and linkages to other macroeconomic statistics. The production of
BPM6 was conducted in parallel with the update of the OECD Benchmark Definition of
Foreign Direct Investment , and the System of National Accounts ( SNA ) to maintain and
enhance consistency among these manuals.

Consultative process

3. The production of BPM6 was characterized by extensive consultation. In addition to
the Committee’s oversight, there was significant outreach to the wider community.

Annotated outline

4. In April 2004, the IMF released an Annotated Outline for the update of the manual.
It included proposals and options for the style and content of the revised manual. Ques-
tions were posed on specific issues to gauge views. The outline was circulated to central
banks and statistical agencies, and was posted on the IMF website. Input was invited from
compilers and other interested parties worldwide. Altogether, 33 countries provided writ-
ten comments.

Technical expert groups

5. The Committee established four technical expert groups, with membership from
member countries and international agencies, to undertake detailed consideration of issues
and make recommendations on currency unions (Currency Union Technical Expert Group,
or CUTEG), direct investment (Direct Investment Technical Expert Group, or DITEG),
reserves (Reserve Assets Technical Expert Group, or RESTEG), and other issues (Balance
of Payments Technical Expert Group, or BOPTEG). DITEG was chaired jointly with the
OECD and had common membership and meetings with the OECD’s Benchmark Advi-
sory Group (BAG) to bring about consistent treatments. The issue papers and outcome
papers were posted on the IMF’s website. Many of the issues discussed also were relevant

xii

for the update of the SNA , thus ensuring coordination with the Advisory Expert Group on
National Accounts (AEG), which had been created by the InterSecretariat Working Group
on National Accounts as an advisory and consultative body for the update of the SNA.
6. In addition, other specialized groups provided input on such topics as trade in ser-
vices, merchandise trade, tourism, remittances, debt statistics, and fiscal statistics. Inter-
national organizations participated in all stages of the process directly and as members of
specialized groups.

Worldwide review
7. Draft versions of the Manual were published on the IMF website in March 2007 and
March 2008. In each case, worldwide comment was invited within a deadline of three months.
About 60 sets of comments were received on the 2007 version, and 20 on the 2008 version. In
addition, other draft versions of selected chapters and of the whole document were circulated
to Committee members, other departments of the IMF, and other interested parties.
8. Furthermore, an expert review of the draft version was undertaken in January 2008
by Mahinder Gill, a retired IMF staff member and former Assistant Director, who super-
vised the drafting of BPM5 , to identify any inconsistencies or omissions in the document,
and to check the consistency with the SNA.
9. During 2008, a series of nine regional outreach seminars was conducted on the Man-
ual to explain the proposed changes and encourage comments on the content and drafting.
Representatives from 173 IMF member economies, along with a number of international
agencies, participated in these seminars and provided many useful suggestions.
10. Taking account of the written comments on the March 2008 draft, inputs from
the regional seminars, and the finalization of Volume 1 of the 2008 SNA , a new draft
version was circulated to Committee members in July 2008. Following a further round
of comments by Committee members and internal IMF review, the BPM6 was adopted
unanimously by the Committee in November 2008.

Major changes introduced
11. The overall framework of the fifth edition is unchanged and BPM6 has a high
degree of continuity with BPM5. Some of the most significant changes from the last edi-
tion are as follows:

Revised treatment of goods for processing and goods under merchanting;
Changes in the measurement of financial services, including Financial Interme-
diation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM), spreads on the purchase and sale
of securities, and the measurement of insurance and pension services;
Elaboration of direct investment (consistent with the OECD Benchmark Definition
of Foreign Direct Investment , notably the recasting in terms of control and influ-
ence, treatment of chains of investment and fellow enterprises, and presentation on
a gross asset and liability basis as well as according to the directional principle);
The introduction of the concepts of reserve-related liabilities, standardized guar-
antees, and unallocated gold accounts;
New concepts for the measurement of international remittances;
Increased focus on balance sheets and balance sheet vulnerabilities (including a
chapter on flows other than those arising from balance of payments transactions);
PREFACE
xiii
Strengthened concordance with the SNA (such as the full articulation of the
SNA/Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual ( MFSM ) financial instrument
classification and the use of the same terminology such as primary and second-
ary income); and
Extensive additions to the Manual , which is double the length of the original
because of added detail and explanation, and new appendixes (such as currency
unions, multinational enterprises, and remittances).
12. A detailed list of changes from BPM5 is provided in Appendix 8 of the Manual.

13. The BPM6 was produced under the direction of three Directors of the Statistics
Department (STA): Carol Carson (2001–04), Robert W. Edwards (2004–08), and Adelheid
Burgi-Schmelz (2008–). Lucie Laliberté was the responsible Deputy Director (2004–).
14. In the Balance of Payments Divisions, the editor of the BPM6 throughout the
project was Robert Dippelsman, Senior Economist, who provided the essential expert
continuity. Robert Dippelsman and Manik Shrestha, a Senior Economist and coeditor,
2002–06, were primary drafters of both the Annotated Outline and BPM6. The project
was supervised by Neil Patterson, Assistant Director (2001–06); Robert Heath, Division
Chief (2003–08); and Ralph Kozlow, Division Chief (2007–).
15. Many staff of the Balance of Payments Divisions contributed to the project.
John Joisce, Senior Economist (2001–), was closely involved in various aspects of
the project throughout. The following Senior Economist staff drafted Appendixes:
Andrew Kitili (Appendixes 1 and 2), René Fiévet (Appendix 3), and Margaret Fitzgib-
bon (Appendix 4). Jens Reinke, Economist, drafted Appendix 5. Pedro Rodriguez, an
Economist in the IMF’s Strategy, Policy, and Review Department (SPR), contributed
material for Chapter 14. In addition to staff mentioned above, the following members
of the Balance of Payments Divisions conducted the nine regional seminars in 2008:
He Qi and Emmanuel Kumah (Deputy Division Chiefs); and Paul Austin, Thomas
Alexander, Antonio Galicia, John Motala, and Tamara Razin (Senior Economists).
Within the staff of the Balance of Payments Divisions, Simon Quin (Deputy Division
Chief); Colleen Cardillo, Jean Galand, Gillmore Hoefdraad, Natalia Ivanik, Eduardo
Valdivia-Velarde, and Mark van Wersch (Senior Economists); and Sergei Dodzin, an
Economist in SPR, made notable contributions to improving the overall quality of the
BPM.
16. Carmen Diaz-Zelaya and Marlene Pollard prepared the BPM6 drafts for publica-
tion. In addition to these staff, Esther George, Elva Harris, and Patricia Poggi supported
the preparation of papers for presentation at the Committee or technical expert group
meetings.

The Committee

17. The BPM6 was prepared under the auspices of the Committee. The BPM6 ben-
efited immensely from the expert advice of Committee members throughout the process;
their contribution was crucial to the success of the project. The Statistics Department
wishes to acknowledge, with thanks, the members and the representatives of international
organizations on the Committee during 2001–08:

A. Purposes of the Manual
1.1 The sixth edition of the Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual ( BPM6 ,
the Manual ) serves as the standard framework for sta-
tistics on the transactions and positions between an
economy and the rest of the world.

1.2 The main objectives of this Manual are as
follows:

(a) To provide and explain concepts, definitions,
classifications, and conventions for balance of
payments and international investment position
statistics;
(b) To enhance international comparability of data
through the promotion of guidelines adopted
internationally;
(c) To show the links of balance of payments and
international investment position statistics to
other macroeconomic statistics and promote
consistency between different data sets; and
(d) To provide a brief introduction to uses of data on
balance of payments, other changes in financial
assets and liabilities, and international invest-
ment position, as the international accounts of
an economy.
1.3 Data collection and other compilation proce-
dures and dissemination are not generally within the
scope of a conceptual manual such as this one. Deci-
sions on such issues should take into account circum-
stances, such as practical and legal constraints, and
relative size, that need to be judged in each economy
and that may explain departures from guidelines. The
IMF’s Balance of Payments Compilation Guide pro-
vides information on these issues.

1.4 The Manual provides a framework that is applica-
ble for a range of economies, from the smallest and least
developed economies to the more advanced and complex
economies. As a result, it is recognized that some items

may not be relevant in all cases. It is the responsibil-
ity of national compilers to apply international guide-
lines in a way appropriate to their own circumstances. In
implementing this Manual , compilers are encouraged to
assess the materiality and practicality of particular items
according to their own circumstances and are further
encouraged to revisit these decisions from time to time to
see whether circumstances have changed. Such decisions
necessarily rely on the professionalism and knowledge of
the compilers.
1.5 Factors to take into account when determin-
ing the items to be collected and the techniques used
include whether or not exchange controls exist, the rela-
tive importance of particular types of economic activi-
ties, and the diversity of institutions and the range of
instruments used in financial markets. In addition, data
collection for some items in the framework may be
impractical if the item is small and the data collection
cost is high. Conversely, compilers may wish to iden-
tify other items of particular economic interest in their
economy for which additional detail may be required
by policymakers and analysts.
1.6 This Manual is harmonized with the System
of National Accounts 2008 ( 2008 SNA ), which was
updated in parallel. Relevant elements of the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual 2000 and Govern-
ment Finance Statistics Manual 2001 will be revised
to maintain their harmonization with the two updated
manuals. Conceptual interlinkages mean that balance
of payments and international investment position com-
pilers should consult with other statisticians to ensure
consistent definitions and provide data that can be rec-
onciled where they overlap.
1.7 The definitions and classifications in this Man-
ual do not purport to give effect to, or interpret, various
provisions (which pertain to the legal characterization
of official action or inaction in relation to such transac-
tions) of the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund.
B. Structure of the Manual
1.8 The Manual has 14 chapters and 9 appendixes.
Theintroductorychaptersdealwithissuesthatcutacross

ters that cover respectively each main account (Chapters
7–13),closingwithachapteronanalysisofdata.The
Manual states general principles that are intended to be
applicable in a wide range of circumstances. As well, it
applies the principles to some specific topics that have
been identified as needing additional guidance. Defini-
tions are given throughout the text, shown in italics.

(b) Chapter 2 covers the accounting and dissemina-
tion frameworks.
(c) Chapter3dealswithaccountingprinciples.
(d) Chapters 4 deals with issues associated with
units, sectors, and residence.
(e) Chapter 5 deals with the classification of assets
and liabilities.
(f) Chapter 6 explains the functional categories.
2. Chapters for each account

to explain financial assets and liability positions before
dealing with the investment income they generate.

1.12 Each chapter starts with a statement of general
economic principles. A simplified table designed to
give an overview of the account is also included in
each chapter. The text provides general definitions

C. History of the Manual
1.17 Each new edition of the Manual is introduced
in response to economic and financial developments,
changesinanalyticalinterests,andaccumulationof
experience by compilers.

1.18 TheIMFshowedearlyinterestinstatistical
methodologywithitspublicationofthefirsteditionof
the Balance of Payments Manual in January 1948. The
major objective of that first Manual wastoprovidea
basis for regular, internationally standardized reporting
totheIMF.The Manual wasacontinuationofwork
startedbytheLeagueofNationstodevelopguide-
lines for balance of payments statistics. Economists and
other specialists from many countries contributed to
the Manual , and representatives of some 30 countries
and international organizations met in Washington,
D.C.,inSeptember1947tofinalizethefirstdraftof
the Manual.

1.19 Thefirsteditionofthe Manual consisted pri-
marily of tables for reporting data and brief instruc-
tionsforcompletingthem.Nogeneraldiscussionof
balance of payments concepts or compilation methods
wasincluded,soitcanbesaidthatthe Manual grew out
of the listing of standard components.

1.20 The second edition was published in 1950,
greatlyexpandingthematerialdescribingtheconcepts
of the system.

1.21 The third edition was issued in 1961. It moved
beyond the previous editions by providing both a basis
for reporting to the IMF and a complete set of balance

of payments principles that could be used by countries
to serve their own needs.
1.22 The fourth edition was published in 1977.
Itrespondedtotheimportantchangesinthewayin
which international transactions were carried out and
to changes in the international financial system. Much
fullertreatmentsoftheunderlyingprinciplesofresi-
dence, valuation, and other accounting principles were
provided. The Manual also introduced flexibility in the
use of the standard components to construct various
balances, with no single presentation preferred.
1.23 ThefiftheditionwaspublishedinSeptem-
ber1993,followingalongperiodofdevelopmentthat

sistencies. BPM5 broughtaboutanumberofchanges
in definitions, terminology, and the structure of the
accounts, including removing capital transfers and non-
producedassetsfromthecurrentaccounttoanewly
designated capital account, the renaming of the capi-
talaccountasthefinancialaccount,andsplittingser-
vices from primary income (which previously had been
called factor services). Additionally, BPM5 introduced
microfoundations of units and sectors, consistent with
the SNA ,ratherthantreatingtheeconomyasasingle
unit.Inaddition,the Manual wasextendedbeyondbal-
ance of payments statistics to include the international
investment position.
1.24 The IMF subsequently published the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual 2000 and Government
Financial Statistics Manual 2001. These manuals also
brought about further harmonization of the statistical
guidelines,reflectingincreasingconcernsaboutthe
ability to link different statistical data, minimizing data
inconsistency, and enhancing analytical potential.
1.25 In1992,theIMFestablishedtheIMFCommit-
tee on Balance of Payments Statistics (the Committee),
as a continuing body for consultation with national
compilers and international organizations. A procedure
wasestablishedforpartialrevisionsofstatisticalguide-
lines between major revisions, as was done in the late
1990s for financial derivatives and aspects of direct
investment. (The procedures for partial revisions are
setoutinSectionE.)
Chapter 1 g Introduction
1.26 A number of related publications have been
developed since the 1993 edition. The Balance of Pay-
ments Compilation Guide was published in 1995. The
Guide complemented the Manual by providing practi-
cal advice on the collection and compilation of statis-
tics. The Balance of Payments Textbook was released
in 1996. It has a teaching orientation, for instance, giv-
ing numerical examples to illustrate general principles.

1.27 Some aspects of international accounts statis-
tics with particular interest were covered in specialized
guides. Those guides are Coordinated Direct Investment
Survey Guide (2008), Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey Guide (1996 and 2001), International Reserves
and Foreign Currency Liquidity: Guidelines for a Data
Tem pla te (2000), Manual on Statistics of International
Trade in Services (2002), External Debt Statistics:
A Guide for Compilers and Users (2003), Bank for
International Settlements Guide to the International
Banking Statistics (2003), International Transactions
in Remittances: Guide for Compilers and Users , and
the OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct
Investment (2008).

D. The 2008 Revision
1.28 At its 2001 meeting, the Committee decided
to initiate an update of the Manual by around 2008.
It was considered that although the overall frame-
work of the fifth edition did not need to change, a
new Manual should incorporate the numerous elabo-
rations and clarifications that had been identified
since 1993. Also, the sixth edition should strengthen
the theoretical foundations and linkages to other
macroeconomic statistics.

1.29 The Committee also decided to conduct the
update in parallel with the update of the 1993 SNA
and OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct
Investment.

1.30 The IMF released, through the Committee,
an Annotated Outline for the update of the Manual
in April 2004. It included proposals and options for
the style and content of the revised Manual. It was
circulated to central banks and statistical agencies,
as well as being made available on the Internet. Input
was invited from compilers and others on a global
basis. The Committee established technical expert
groups to undertake detailed consideration of issues
and make recommendations on currency unions,
direct investment, reserves, and other issues, respec-
tively. Draft versions of the Manual were published

on the IMF website in March 2007 and March 2008,
with invitations for worldwide comment. In addition,
other editions of selected chapters and the whole
document were circulated to Committee members
and other interested parties. A series of regional out-
reach seminars was conducted between January and
September 2008 to explain the changes in the Man-
ual and gain comments on the content. This process
led to a revised version submitted to the Committee
in November 2008.
1.31 Three major themes that have emerged
from the revision are globalization, increasing elabora-
tion of balance sheet issues, and financial innovation.
1.32 Globalization has brought several issues to
greater prominence. An increasing number of individ-
uals and companies have connections to two or more
economies and economies increasingly enter into
economic arrangements. In particular, there has been
increasing interest in the residence concept and in
information on migrant workers and their associated
remittance flows. Additionally, globalized production
processes have become more important, so treatments
have been developed to provide a fuller and more
coherent picture of outsourced physical processes (i.e.,
goods for processing) and sales and management of
manufacturing that do not involve physical posses-
sion (i.e., merchanting). Guidance is provided on the
residence and activities of special purpose entities and
other legal structures that are used for holding assets
and that have little or no physical presence. The results
of work on international trade in services and remit-
tances are included. Furthermore, for the first time,
specific guidance on the treatment of currency unions
is included.
1.33 The Manual reflects increased interest in bal-
ance sheet analysis for understanding international
economic developments, particularly vulnerability
and sustainability. Greater emphasis and elaboration
of the financial instrument classification in the SNA
and Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual are
designed to facilitate linkages and consistency. The
Manual provides considerably more detailed guid-
ance on the international investment position. It also
provides much greater discussion of revaluations and
other volume changes and their impact on the values
of assets and liabilities. The results of detailed work
over the past decade on international investment
position, direct investment, external debt, portfolio
investment, financial derivatives, and reserve assets
are incorporated into the new Manual. The move to
an integrated view of transactions, other changes, and
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

positions has been recognized in the amended title as
Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual , with the acronym BPM6 used to
highlight the historical evolution from previous edi-
tions of the Manual , which were known as BPM5 ,
BPM4 , and so on.

1.34 Financial innovation is the emergence and
growth of new financial instruments and arrangements
among institutional units. Examples of instruments
covered include financial derivatives, securitization,
index-linked securities, and gold accounts. An example
of institutional arrangements are special purpose enti-
ties and complex, multieconomy corporate structures.
Enhanced guidelines cover direct investment in cases
of long and complex chains of ownership, revised in
conjunction with the revised OECD Benchmark Defi-
nition of Foreign Direct Investment. Revised treat-
ments of insurance and other financial services are
adopted. The Manual also provides expanded treat-
ment on the issues of loan impairments, debt reorga-
nization, guarantees, and write-offs.

1.35 In addition, the Manual incorporates changes
arising from other statistical manuals, particularly the
2008 SNA. The harmonization with other macroeco-
nomic statistics is strengthened in terms of presentation
by more details on the underlying economic concepts
and their associated links with the equivalent parts of
the SNA and other manuals. Other changes were made
in response to requests to provide clarification or fur-
ther detail on particular topics.

1.36 The overall structure of the accounts and broad
definitions are largely unchanged in this edition, so the
changes are less structural than those made for the fifth
edition. Rather, economic and financial developments
and evolution of economic policy concerns are taken
into account, and clarification and elaboration of these
developments are provided. A list of changes made in
this edition of the Manual is included as Appendix 8.

E. Revisions between Editions of the Manual
1.37 The IMF and the Committee have developed
procedures for updating the Manual on an ongoing
basis between major revisions. Under these procedures,
updates can be divided into four types:

(a) editorial amendments;
(b) clarifications beyond dispute;
(c) interpretations; and
(d) changes.
Each of these types of updates has a different set of steps
that are to be followed in the consultation process.
1.38 Editorial amendments refer to wording errors,
apparent contradictions, and, for non-English versions
of the Manual , translation errors. These corrections
affect neither concepts nor the structure of the system.
IMF staff will draft these amendments, which will be
brought to the Committee for advice. An errata sheet
will then be produced, and the amendments will be
publicized on the website.
1.39 A clarification beyond dispute arises when
a new economic situation emerges or when a situation
that was negligible when the Manual was produced has
become considerably more important, but for which
the appropriate treatment under existing standards is
straightforward. IMF staff will draft these clarifica-
tions, based on existing recommendations, and after
advice from the Committee, they will be publicized on
the website and by other means.
1.40 An interpretation arises when an economic
situation arises for which the treatment under the
Manual may not be clear. Several solutions on how
to treat the situation may be proposed, because it is
possible to have different interpretations of the Man-
ual. In this case, IMF staff, in consultation with the
Committee, will draft preliminary text that will be
sent to panels of experts, and to the InterSecretariat
Working Group on National Accounts (ISWGNA) (if
also relevant to the SNA ). IMF staff will propose a
final decision, in consultation with the Committee.
Interpretations will be publicized on the website and
by other means.
1.41 A change to the framework arises when an
economic situation occurs in which it becomes appar-
ent that the concepts and definitions of the framework
are not relevant or are misleading and will require
change. In such a situation, parts of the Manual may
need to be substantially rewritten to reflect the needed
changes. In such a case, IMF staff, in consultation with
the Committee, will prepare proposals that will be dis-
seminated widely to panels of experts, the ISWGNA (if
also relevant to the SNA ), and all IMF member coun-
tries. The Committee will advise how such changes
should be incorporated into the framework, whether
promulgated immediately through a booklet detailing
the amendments to the Manual or by issuing a new
Manual. Information will be produced and provided to
all countries with changes also publicized on the IMF
website and by other means.

3. Balance of payments

2.12 The balance of payments is a statistical state-
ment that summarizes transactions between residents
and nonresidents during a period. It consists of the goods
and services account, the primary income account, the
secondary income account, the capital account, and
the financial account. Under the double-entry account-
ingsystemthatunderliesthebalanceofpayments,each

on the double-entry accounting system.)

2.13 Thedifferentaccountswithinthebalanceof

the economic resources provided and received.

Current account

vices, primary income, and secondary income between
residents and nonresidents .Thecurrentaccountisan

ing chapters:

Chapter 10 discusses the goods and services
account. This account shows transactions in goods
and services.
Chapter 11 discusses the primary income account.
This account shows amounts payable and receiv-
able in return for providing temporary use to
another entity of labor, financial resources, or non-
produced nonfinancial assets.^1

Chapter 12 discusses the secondary income
account. This account shows redistribution of
income, that is, when resources for current pur-
poses are provided by one party without anything
ofeconomicvaluebeingsuppliedasadirectreturn
to that party. Examples include personal transfers
and current international assistance.
2.15 The balance on these accounts is known as the
current account balance. The current account balance

ondaryincome).AsshowninChapter14,Selected
IssuesinBalanceofPaymentsandInternationalInvest-
ment Position Analysis, the value of the current account
balance equals the saving-investment gap for the econ-
omy. Thus, the current account balance is related to
understanding domestic transactions.
Capital account
2.16 The capital account shows credit and debit
entries for nonproduced nonfinancial assets and capital
transfersbetweenresidentsandnonresidents.Itrecords
acquisitions and disposals of nonproduced nonfinan-

Financial account
2.17 The financial account shows net acquisition and
disposal of financial assets and liabilities. This account
is described in Chapter 8. Financial account transac-
tions appear in the balance of payments and, because

4. Accumulation accounts
2.20 The accumulation accounts comprise the capi-
tal account, financial account, and other changes in
financial assets and liabilities accounts. They show the
accumulation (i.e., acquisition and disposal) of assets
and liabilities, their financing, and other changes that
affect them. Accordingly, they explain changes between
theopeningandclosingIIP/balancesheets.Whereas
the current account is concerned with resource flows

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL
Recording for individual transactions
The recording of debits and credits underlies the account-
ingsystematthelevelofindividualtransactions.Eachtrans-
action in the balance of payments is recorded as consisting
of two equal and opposite entries, reflecting the inflow and
outflow element to each exchange. For each transaction, each
partyrecordsamatchingcreditanddebitentry:
Credit (CR.)—exports of goods and services, income
receivable, reduction in assets, or increase in liabilities.
Debit (DR.) —imports of goods and services, income
payable, increase in assets, or reduction in liabilities.
Examples
Asimpleexampleisforsaleofgoodstoanonresident
for100incurrency.Fortheseller:
Exports 100 (CR.)
Currency 100 (DR.—Increase in financial assets)
(The transaction involves the provision of physical
resourcestononresidentsandacompensatingreceiptof
financial resources from nonresidents.)
An example of a transaction involving only financial
asset entries is the sale of shares for 50 in currency. For
the seller:
Shares and 50 (CR.—Reduction in financial assets)
other equity
Currency 50 (DR.—Increase in financial assets)
(The selling party provides shares and receives cur-
rencyinreturn.)

creationofaliabilityiswhereaborrowerreceivesaloan

Currency 70 (DR.—Increase in financial assets)
(There are some more complex cases when three or
morepartiesareinvolved,e.g.,thecaseofdebtassump-
tion shown in Box 8.1.)
Aggregate recording
Inbalanceofpaymentsaggregates,thecurrentand
capital account entries are totals, while financial account
entries are net values for each category/instrument for
each of assets and liabilities (as explained in paragraph
3.31).Chapter3,AccountingPrinciples,PartCprovides

ance of payments statistics.

The two-entry nature of the balance of payments can
be presented in aggregate data in different ways. A pre-
sentationwherethenatureoftheentriesisconveyed

Box 2.1. Double-Entry Basis of Balance of Payments Statistics
oriented to the current period, the accumulation accounts
deal with the provision and financing of assets and liabil-
ities, which are items that will affect future periods.

2.21 The financial account shows the net acquisition
of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities dur-
ing the specified period. In contrast, the other changes
in financial assets and liabilities account shows flows
that do not result from balance of payments transac-
tions. The other changes in financial assets and lia-
bilities account covers changes in volume, other than
balance of payments transactions; revaluation due to
exchange rate changes; and other revaluation. This
account is described further in Chapter 9.

5. Integrated recording of positions and
transactions

2.22 As highlighted in the previous sections, the
international accounts, inclusive of the IIP and bal-
ance of payments, consist of a set of accounts that are
integrated at two levels. First, while the accounts repre-
sent a great mass of detailed information on interaction
between the different economic agents, their recording
is based on the double-entry system of accounting, as
set out in Box 2.1.

2.23 Second, the system calls for consistent report-
ing by the two parties to each financial claim, transac-
tion, and other flow. In the case of the international
accounts, this consistency helps to promote compara-
bility across economies as well as the use of counter-
part data as data sources or for data validation.

6. Net errors and omissions

2.24 Although the balance of payments accounts
are, in principle, balanced, imbalances result in prac-
tice from imperfections in source data and compilation.
This imbalance, a usual feature of balance of payments
data, is labeled net errors and omissions and should be
identified separately in published data. It should not be
included indistinguishably in other items. Net errors and
omissions are derived residually as net lending /net bor-
rowing and can be derived from the financial account
minus the same item derived from the current and capital
accounts.^2 Therefore, a positive value of net errors and
omissions indicates an overall tendency that:

(^2) For example, if net lending/net borrowing measured from the
current and capital accounts is 29, while net lending/net borrow-
ing measured from the financial account is 31, then net errors and
omissions is +2.
(a) the value of credits in the current and capital
accounts is too low; and/or
(b) the value of debits in the current and capital
accounts is too high; and/or
(c) the value of net increases in assets in the finan-
cial account is too high; and/or
(d) the value of net increases in liabilities in the
financial account is too low.
(For a negative value of net errors and omissions, these
tendencies are reversed.)
2.25 The values of net errors and omissions should
be analyzed by compilers. The size and trends may help
identify data problems, such as coverage or misreport-
ing. Patterns in net errors and omissions may provide
useful information on data problems. For example, a
consistent sign indicates a bias in one or more compo-
nents. A persistent positive value of net errors and omis-
sions suggests that credit entries have been understated
or omitted or debit entries have been overstated. In con-
trast, a volatile pattern may suggest timing problems.
However, although net errors and omissions can help
point to some problems, it is an incomplete measure
because errors and omissions in opposite directions
offset each other. The term net errors and omissions
should not be interpreted as meaning errors on the part
of compilers; it is far more common that this discrep-
ancy is caused by other factors, such as incomplete data
sources and poor quality reporting.
2.26 A large or volatile value of net errors and omis-
sions hampers interpretation of the results. While it is
not possible to give guidelines on an acceptable size
of net errors and omissions, it can be assessed (where
possible) by compilers in relation to other items, such
as GDP, positions data, and gross flows. Statistical dis-
crepancies also can arise in the IIP statement. Closing
values are by definition equal to the opening values
plus net transactions plus net other changes during the
period. However, if these components are indepen-
dently measured, discrepancies may arise because of
data imperfections.

7. Linkages within the international accounts
2.27 Some of the important linkages within the
international accounts are as follows:
(a) The end of period values of the IIP are the sum
of the beginning of period values, transactions,
and other flows.
(b) The current, capital, and financial account entries
are in balance, in principle.

Chapter 2 g Overview of the Framework
(c) Consequent to (b), the balance on the sum of
thecurrentandcapitalaccountsisequaltothe
balanceonthefinancialaccount.Thisbalance
is called net lending/net borrowing, whichever
way it is derived.
(d) Consequent to (b), the current account balance is
equal to the balance on the financial account less
the balance on the capital account.
(e) Financial assets and liabilities generally give rise
to investment income. Table 5.2 shows the link
between financial instruments and their corre-
sponding income. The rate of return is derived
as the ratio of income to the corresponding stock
of assets or liabilities. (Rates of return might
also take into account holding gains or losses for
some analysis.)
2.28 Because of the harmonization of macroeco-
nomicstatisticalguidelines,itisalsopossibletolookat
residents’ transactions and positions with nonresidents
in relation to the transactions and positions between
residents. For example:

(a) the international financing can be compared with
domestic lending and borrowing; and
(b) theIIPcanbecomparedwiththenationalbal-
ance sheet and with monetary and financial
statistics.
Chapter 14, Selected Issues in Balance of Payments and
InternationalInvestmentPositionAnalysis,hasawider
discussion of interrelationships between the interna-
tional accounts and other macroeconomic data.

8. Linkages and consistency with other
data sets

2.29 Placing the international accounts in the
SNA framework shown in Figure 2.1 helps identify
linkages among macroeconomic data sets. Specific
aspects of the international accounts are provided,
forinstance,inreportingstatementsonmerchandise
trade, trade in services, direct investment, external
debt, and international reserves. Additionally, items
involving flows and positions between residents and
nonresidents that appear in the national accounts,
monetary and financial statistics, and government
finance statistics correspond exactly to international
accounts items.

2.30 The following paragraphs list data items that
should be consistent with the international accounts.

ently.Forexample,ifdataareconsistent,itispossible

National accounts
2.31 The international accounts correspond to the
rest of the world accounts of the SNA .Theydifferin
that the balance of payments is from the perspective of
theresidentsectors,whereasnationalaccountsdatafor
therestoftheworldarefromtheperspectiveofnon-
residents. The SNA items that are equivalent to balance
ofpaymentsitemsincludeexportsandimportsofgoods
and services, primary income, secondary income, cur-
rent external balance, balance on the capital account,
and net lending /net borrowing.
Monetary and financial statistics
2.32 Balancesheetsfordeposit-takingandother
financial corporations can be compared with the rel-
evantpartsoftheIIP.Inparticular:
foreign assets and liabilities of the central bank;
and
foreign assets and liabilities of other deposit-taking
corporations
should be consistent with the corresponding interna-
tionalaccountsitems.BecausetheIIPdataareorga-
nizedprimarilyonafunctionalcategorybasis,the

categories need to be combined if they are to be linked
with monetary and financial statistics. Direct invest-
ment,ifany,ofthecentralbankandotherdeposit-
taking corporations is needed to derive aggregates
consistent with monetary and financial statistics, and
thus is shown as a supplementary item where relevant.
Other adjustments may be needed for any deposit-
taking corporations whose liabilities are excluded from
broadmoney(e.g.,offshorebanksinsomecases)orfor
othertypesofcorporationsincludedinbroadmoney
(such as money market funds) and thus are included with
the deposit-taking corporations subsector in monetary
statistics.
2.33 Incasesinwhichmonetarystatisticsalso

period may differ from the transactions in foreign assets
and liabilities in the monetary statistics to the extent
that balance of payments statistics exclude transactions
in foreign assets and liabilities between residents. See
also paragraphs 14.20–14.22 on the possibility of linking
these transactions through the monetary presentation of
the balance of payments.

Government finance statistics

2.34 The following items that appear in government
finance statistics should be consistent with their inter-
national accounts equivalents:

interest payable on general government external
debt;
grants by general government to nonresidents;
grants to general government from nonresidents;
net external financing; and
external assets and liabilities.
(Direct investment of general government, if any, is
needed to derive aggregates consistent with govern-

ment finance statistics. Thus, it is shown as a supple-
mentary item where relevant.)
9. Numerical example

2.35 Table 2.1 provides a numerical overview of
the international accounts, using data drawn from the
SNA framework presented in Annex 2.2. (The numeri-
cal example helps show interrelationships between
items.)
2.36 The international accounts data have the
same scope as the rest of the world sector in the SNA.
However, the international accounts are expressed
from the perspective of the resident units, but in
the SNA , the data for the rest of world sector are
expressed from the perspective of the nonresident
units. So, the current account surplus of 13 in Table
2.1 is presented as a current external balance for the
rest of the world sector of –13 in the table in Annex
2.2. Similarly, closing assets of 1,346 in the IIP are
shown as the liabilities of 1,346 of the rest of the
world sector in the SNA.

1. Metadata, dissemination standards, and
data quality

2.37 Metadata are systematic, descriptive infor-
mation about data content and organization .They
provide information on the concepts, sources, and
methods underlying the data and therefore help users
to understand and assess the characteristics of the
data. Statistical compilers should provide metadata to
their users because metadata are an integral part of
thepublicationofstatistics.

2.38 Good dissemination practices are essential in
addition to good data compilation. As well as provi-
sion of metadata, aspects of good dissemination prac-
tices include predictable release schedule, availability
of publications, and identification of internal govern-
ment access to statistics before public release. In recent
years,internationalguidelineshavebeendevelopedon
good data dissemination practices, namely, the IMF’s
General Data Dissemination System and Special Data
Dissemination Standard.

2.40 While the tables included in the Manual have
been designed to highlight classifications and inter-
relationships, tabulations for users will generally use
timeseries.Goodpracticesinthecompilationofinter-

2.41 Seasonal adjustment of monthly and quar-
terlydataispotentiallyusefulfortimeseriesdatain
both analysis and compilation. However, some inter-
national accounts items, especially in the financial

because of the high degree of irregularity associated
with large, one-time transactions.

Chapter 3. Accounting Principles
A. Introduction
3.1 This chapter discusses the nature of basic entries
in the international accounts and the accounting prin-
ciples governing their recording. Entries in the interna-
tional accounts are either flows or stocks. In the context
of international accounts, stocks are called positions. The
entries are recorded following a consistent set of account-
ing principles to ensure a complete integration of flows
and positions as well as symmetry of recording between
counterparties. This chapter first describes the important
characteristics of flows and positions. It then explains the
double-entry and quadruple-entry bookkeeping systems
in the context of international accounts. Finally, the chap-
ter describes general accounting principles concerning
the time of recording, valuation, and aggregation and net-
ting. Descriptions of specific types of flows and positions
and the application of general accounting principles to
their recording are discussed in relevant chapters.

3.2 Flows refer to economic actions and effects of
events within an accounting period, and positions refer
to a level of assets or liabilities at a point in time.
International flows are recorded in the accounts as
transactions (balance of payments) and other changes
in financial assets and liabilities account. Flows and
positions are integrated so that all changes in posi-
tions between two points in time are fully explained
by the recorded flows. Positions and flows of financial
assets and liabilities are grouped according to the func-
tional and instrument classifications of financial assets

and liabilities. Nonfinancial transactions are generally
grouped according to their nature and characteristics.
Positions of external financial assets and liabilities are
shown in the international investment position. Descrip-
tions of specific types of flows are discussed in the
relevant chapters. The classification of financial assets
and liabilities is discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.
1. Flows
3.3 Flows reflect the creation, transformation,
exchange, transfer, or extinction of economic value;
they involve changes in the volume, composition, or
value of an institutional unit’s assets and liabilities.
This classification is the basis for the flow accounts, as
discussed in Chapters 8–13. Flows also can be classi-
fied into (a) those that are associated with transactions
and (b) other flows.

a. Transactions
3.4 A transaction is an interaction between two
institutional units that occurs by mutual agreement
or through the operation of the law and involves an
exchange of value or a transfer. Transactions are clas-
sified according to the nature of the economic value
provided—namely, goods or services, primary income,
secondary income, capital transfers, nonproduced non-
financial assets, financial assets, or liabilities. Chapters
8 and 10–13 deal with transactions. Mutual agreement
means that there is prior knowledge and consent by
the institutional units. Transactions imposed by force
of law are applicable mainly to certain distributive
transactions, such as the payment of taxes, fines, and
penalties. Although taxes or penalties are imposed
on individual institutional units by administrative or
judicial decisions, there is collective recognition and
acceptance by the community of the obligation to pay
taxes and penalties. Because of the exchange of value,
a transaction consists of two economic flows, one in
each direction—for example, goods supplied by one
party in return for currency supplied by the other.
The definition is extended to cover actions within an
institutional unit that are analytically useful to treat as
transactions, often because the unit is operating in two
different capacities, such as where one part operates as
a branch. The definition is also extended to cover unre-
quited transfers, by the identification of transfers as the
corresponding flow to the economic value supplied.
Transactions recorded in the international accounts are
between two institutional units, one a resident of the
compiling economy and the other a nonresident.^1

3.5 Illegal transactions are treated the same way
as legal actions. Illegal transactions are those that are
forbidden by law. Illegal economic actions are transac-
tions only when the institutional units involved enter
the actions by mutual agreement. Otherwise, they
are other flows. Macroeconomic statistics, including
international accounts, cover all economic phenomena
irrespective of whether they are illegal or legal. Differ-
ences in the definition of illegal transactions between
economies or within an economy over time would
cause inconsistencies in the international accounts if
illegal transactions were omitted. Furthermore, illegal
transactions generally affect other legal transactions
(e.g., certain legal external financial claims may be cre-
ated through illegal exports of goods). Thus, exclusion
of illegal transactions could lead to an imbalance in the
international accounts.

3.6 Transactions recorded in the balance of payments
are interactions between a resident and a nonresident
institutional unit. By the nature of international accounts,
intra-unit transactions are not recorded. The flows
between the branch and its parent enterprise are shown
as interactions between institutional units, with a branch
recognized as a separate institutional unit (a quasi-cor-
poration). Similarly, when a notional enterprise (a quasi-
corporation) is created for holding land and associated
buildings by nonresident owners, the flows between the
nonresident owners and the notional enterprise are con-
sidered interactions between institutional units.

3.7 Transactions between two resident institutional
units in external assets are domestic transactions. Such
transactions, however, affect the external asset posi-

(^1) As stated in paragraph 3.6, however, notional institutional units
are created to account for cross-border transactions that occur
within a single corporation. In the national accounts, transactions
cover also some actions within an institutional unit (intra-unit trans-
actions) with the purpose of providing a more analytically useful
picture of output, final uses, and costs. Examples include consump-
tion of fixed capital, movements in inventories, and production for
own final use of goods by producers.
tions of the two resident units involved. The external
asset position of one resident unit is reduced and the
position in the same external asset of another resident
unit is increased, and thus leads to a change in domestic
sectoral breakdown if the two parties are in different
sectors. Such transactions result in changes in structure
of external asset positions and should be recorded in the
international accounts as a reclassification of sectors
of holding (i.e., in the other changes in financial assets
and liabilities account).^2 If both units fall in the same
institutional sector, such reclassification entries can-
cel each other out and thus have no effect on sectoral
positions. Similarly, when financial instruments issued
by residents are exchanged between nonresidents, no
transactions are recorded in the balance of payments
and there is no change in overall external liabilities.^3
3.8 To establish whether a transaction involving
an external financial asset is a transaction between a
resident and a nonresident, the compiler must know the
identities of both parties. The information available on
transactions in claims constituting external assets may
not, however, permit identification of the two parties
to the transaction. That is, a compiler may not be able
to ascertain whether a resident, who acquired or relin-
quished a claim on a nonresident, conducted the trans-
action with another resident or with a nonresident, or
whether a nonresident dealt with another nonresident or
with a resident. As a result, recorded international trans-
actions may include not only those that involve assets
and liabilities and take place between residents and
nonresidents but also those that involve financial assets
of economies and take place between two residents and,
to a lesser extent, transactions that take place between
nonresidents. (See also paragraphs 4.152–4.153 on the
additional issues associated with partner attribution of
transactions in financial instruments between residents
and nonresidents. In addition, transactions between
residents in external assets and liabilities may have to
be taken into account for specific purposes, particularly
as described in paragraph 14.21.)
3.9 Some mutual agreements involve three parties.
For example, guarantees involve the guarantor, the
debtor, and the creditor. Transactions occurring between
two parties (e.g., between the guarantor and debtor, or
between the guarantor and creditor, or between the
(^2) The resident-to-resident transaction between the buyer and seller
is recorded in the national accounts.
(^3) As discussed in paragraph A3.4, national contributions for com-
piling financial flows data in currency and economic unions may
be allocated along the debtor-creditor approach as a way to ensure
bilateral symmetry.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

debtor and creditor) should always be identified and
recorded as such. For one-off guarantees, the activa-
tion of the guarantee gives rise to transactions and, in
some cases, other flows (for a definition and discussion
of other flows, see paragraphs 3.19–3.22) between each
of the three pairs of the three parties (see paragraphs
8.42–8.45 and 13.27 for the treatment of one-off guar-
antees). For each pair of parties, transactions in the
international accounts are recorded if one party is a
resident and another party is a nonresident.

3.10 Service activities may consist of one unit (an agent)
arranging for a transaction to be carried out between two
other units in return for a fee from one or both parties to
the transaction. In such a case, the transaction is recorded
exclusively in the accounts of the two parties engaging in
the transaction and not in the accounts of the agent facili-
tating the transaction. Therefore, in the case of agents,
transactions should be attributed to the economy of the
principal on whose behalf a transaction is undertaken,
and not to the economy of the agent acting on behalf of
the principal. The accounts of the agent show only the
fee charged to the principal for the facilitation services
rendered (see also paragraph 4.149).

3.11 Each transaction involves two entries, a debit
entry and a credit entry, for each party to the transac-
tion. That is, each transaction consists of two flows
and gives rise to two accounting entries for each party.
(Given that each transaction involves two entries, a
phrase such as a “goods transaction” may be more cor-
rectly called a “transaction involving goods” or “goods
entry” or “goods flow.”) Reclassification also involves
two entries for each economy. All other flows that are
not transactions or reclassification involve only one
entry for each party as they directly affect net worth.

Types of transactions
3.12 Transactions take many different forms. Trans-
actions can be classified according to whether they
are exchanges or transfers (see paragraph 3.13) and
whether they are monetary or nonmonetary (see para-
graph 3.14). Furthermore, certain transactions are
rearranged through rerouting and partitioning (see
paragraphs 3.16–3.17), whereas other transactions may
be imputed to reflect the underlying economic relation-
ship (see paragraph 3.18).

Exchanges or transfers
3.13 Every transaction involves either an exchange
or a transfer. An exchange involves the provision of
something of economic value in return for a corre-
sponding item of economic value. Purchases of goods

and services, acquisition of assets, compensation of
employees, dividends, and so on are all exchanges. An
exchange is sometimes called a transaction with “some-
thing for something” or a transaction with a quid pro
quo. A transaction involving a transfer involves a pro-
vision (or receipt) of an economic value by one party
without receiving (or providing) a corresponding item
of economic value. A transfer entry is used to provide a
corresponding entry to the unrequited flow. Taxes, debt
forgiveness, grants, and personal transfers are examples
of transfers. A transaction involving a transfer is also
called a transaction with “something for nothing” or a
transaction without a quid pro quo.
Monetary or nonmonetary transactions
3.14 Every transaction is either a monetary or non-
monetary transaction. A monetary transaction is one in
which one institutional unit makes a payment (receives
a payment) or incurs a liability (acquires an asset)
stated in units of currency. A nonmonetary transaction
is one not initially stated in units of currency by the
transacting parties. Nonmonetary transactions include
barter transactions, remuneration in kind, payments
in kind, compensation in kind, and transfers in kind.
In kind means that resources are provided in a form
other than funds, such as goods, services, and interest
forgone. For example, provision of foreign aid goods is
a transfer in kind. Because all flows are to be expressed
in monetary terms, the monetary values of nonmon-
etary transactions need to be indirectly measured or
otherwise estimated. The main distinguishing charac-
teristic of a monetary transaction is that the parties to
the transaction express their agreement in monetary
terms, such as a given amount of units of a currency
per unit of a good. Both monetary and nonmonetary
transactions may be either exchanges or transfers.
Rearranging transactions for statistical purposes
3.15 Most transactions can be clearly observed
because the way they take place also reflects the under-
lying economic relationships. Some transactions (as
they appear to the institutional units) do not reflect the
underlying economic relationships, however, and need
to be rearranged so that the accounts portray economic
reality. Rerouting, partitioning, and imputation are
three types of rearrangements employed in the inter-
national accounts.
Rerouting
3.16 Rerouting records a transaction as taking place
in channels different from those observed. For exam-
ple, a direct transaction between unit A and unit C may
Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles
be best understood as a transaction first between unit
A and unit B and second between unit B and unit C.
This most often occurs when a unit that is a party to
a transaction does not appear in the actual accounting
records because of administrative arrangements. Social
contributions paid by employers directly to a retire-
ment scheme are one such example (see paragraphs
12.32–12.39 for recording of social contributions). The
economic substance of such a transaction is revealed by
rerouting: showing the social contributions as part of
compensation of employees that is payable by employ-
ers to employees, who then make social contributions to
the retirement scheme. Similarly, the transfer elements
of lotteries and other gambling are transactions through
the gambling operator, but they are rerouted to occur
directly between those participating in the lottery or
gambling, that is, between households and possibly to
charities (see paragraph 12.25).

Partitioning
3.17 Partitioning unbundles two or more different
transactions that appear as a single transaction from
the perspective of the parties involved. For example,
interest payable and receivable by financial intermedi-
aries is partitioned into two components. One compo-
nent represents the return on investment (pure interest),
while the remainder represents the purchase of financial
intermediation services for which the intermediaries do
not explicitly charge (see paragraphs 10.126–10.136 for
measuring financial intermediation services). Likewise,
when a financial derivative is settled with the delivery
of the underlying asset, this single event should be bro-
ken down into a transaction in the financial derivative
and a separate transaction in the underlying asset. One
example of partitioning and rerouting is the valuation
of goods at FOB (free on board) values, with transpor-
tation and insurance services separately recorded (see
paragraph 10.34 for CIF (cost, insurance, and freight)
and FOB adjustments).

Imputation
3.18 I mput a t ion of t r a n sa c t ion s r efe r s t o c on st r uc t i ng
entries in the accounts when no separate transactions
are identified by the parties involved. As a general rule,
transactions are to be imputed only in specific cases to
reflect underlying economic relationships. Imputation
of transactions in the international accounts is made in
the following specific cases:

(a) Retained earnings of direct investment enter-
prises are attributed to direct investors as if the
retained earnings had been distributed in pro-
portion to direct investors’ shares in the earn-
ings of the direct investment enterprises and
then reinvested by them in the direct investment
enterprise. The rationale behind this treatment
is that, because a direct investment enterprise is,
by definition, subject to control or influence by a
direct investor or investors, the decision to retain
some of its earnings within the enterprise repre-
sents an investment decision on the part of the
direct investor(s). The treatment of the retained
earnings of direct investment enterprises are
described in paragraphs 11.40–11.47.
(b) Investment income earned on technical reserves
held by insurance corporations is deemed to be
payable to policyholders who are then deemed
to return the funds back to insurance corpora-
tions as premium supplements even though in
terms of actual cash flows the property income
is retained by the insurance corporations. The
same treatment is followed for the income earned
by investing the technical reserves for standard-
ized guarantees. Investment income earned on
the technical reserves held by life insurance
corporations and defined contribution pension
schemes as well as the increase in entitlements
during the period for defined benefits pension
schemes are also deemed to be payable to poli-
cyholders who are then deemed to acquire finan-
cial claims on the life insurance corporations
and pension funds. The technical reserves are
liabilities of insurance corporations, guarantors,
and pension funds and assets of policyholders.
Therefore, the investment income attributable
to policyholders provides a measure of income
receivable by the policyholders on their claims.
This imputation provides a more suitable pic-
ture of the disposable income of policyholders,
of their saving, and of production and trade in
insurance services.
(c) Retained earnings of investment funds are
treated as if they were distributed to share-
holders who are then deemed to reinvest in the
investment fund. The treatment and recording
of these transactions are explained in para-
g r aphs 11.37–11.39.
(d) When government has a nonresident entity
undertake fiscal functions related to govern-
ment borrowing or incurring government outlays
abroad with no or incomplete economic flows
between the government and the nonresident
entity related to these fiscal activities, transac-
tions are imputed in the accounts of both the
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

government and the nonresident entity to reflect
the fiscal activities of the government. Imputa-
tions of these transactions are described in para-
graphs 8.24–8.26, 11.40, and 12.48.
(e) Implicit taxes or subsidies associated with a mul-
tiple exchange rate regime are discussed in para-
graph 3.107.
b. Other flows

3.19 Other flows are changes in the volume, value,
or classification of an asset or liability that do not
result from a transaction between a resident and a
nonresident. Other flows are genuine economic phe-
nomena and capture changes in assets and liabilities
between opening and closing positions that are not due
to transactions. In the context of international accounts,
other flows are recorded only for financial assets and
liabilities that represent claims on and liabilities to
nonresidents and gold bullion (see paragraph 3.24),
because the international investment position relates
only to external financial assets and liabilities.

3.20 Other flows cover various kinds of changes in
assets and liabilities that are recognized analytically
under two broad types:

(a) Other changes in the volume of assets and liabil-
ities reflect entrances of new assets into balance
sheets and exits of existing assets and liabilities
from balance sheets that are not caused by inter-
actions by mutual agreement between institu-
tional units (i.e., transactions).
(b) Revaluations (holding gains and losses) on an
asset or liability arise from changes in their
prices and/or the exchange rates. In interna-
tional accounts, revaluations are further clas-
sified into those that are due to exchange rate
changes and those that are due to other price
changes.
3.21 Other changes in the volume of assets and lia-
bilities are recorded when either:

(a) new assets that were not in the opening balance
sheet appear in closing balance sheet,
(b) or existing assets that were in the opening bal-
ance sheet disappear from the closing balance
sheet,
(c) and these appearances or disappearances are not
the result of transactions.
Included are write-offs of claims by creditors, reclas-
sification of assets, monetization and demonetization

of gold bullion, and other events. If debt forgiveness is
provided, such as in a noncommercial setting, transac-
tions are recorded (see paragraphs 13.22–13.23). In
the case of debt cancellations, it may sometimes be
unclear whether they should be classified as transac-
tions or other flows. In commercial settings, in the
absence of specific information, debt cancellation can
be treated as other changes in the volume of assets
(see also paragraphs 9.8–9.11). Changes in the sta-
tus of existing financial claims and liabilities arising
from the change in residence of individuals from one
economy to another are treated as other changes in the
volume of assets. These flows result from a change
in the classification of the owner’s residence status,
and hence, they should not be classified as transac-
tions (see also paragraphs 9.21–9.23). Assumption of
debts arising from the activation of guarantees and
rescheduling of debts and are the results of mutual
agreements between the parties and, hence, are clas-
sified as transactions (see paragraphs 8.42–8.45 and
8.54, respectively).
3.22 A separate account (other changes in financial
assets and liabilities account) shows changes in assets
and liabilities due to other flows. Chapter 9 describes
the structure of this account as well as various catego-
ries of other flows and their treatment.
2. Positions

3.23 Positions refer to the level of financial assets or
liabilities at a point in time. They are recorded in the
international investment position, which is a balance sheet
of external financial assets and liabilities. Generally, posi-
tions are shown at the beginning and end of an accounting
period. Positions between two periods are connected with
flows during that period because changes in positions are
caused by transactions and other flows.
3.24 Financial assets are economic assets that are
financial instruments. Financial assets include finan-
cial claims and, by convention, monetary gold held in
the form of gold bullion (including gold held in allo-
cated gold accounts). A financial claim is a financial
instrument that has a counterpart liability. Gold bullion
is not a claim and does not have a corresponding liabil-
ity. It is treated as a financial asset, however, because
of its special role as a means of financial exchange in
international payments by monetary authorities and as
a reserve asset held by monetary authorities.
3.25 The international investment position covers
financial assets and liabilities that have an international
character. All financial claims involve two parties, so
Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles
they have an international character if the claim is on a
nonresident. Similarly, all liabilities involve two parties,
so they have an international character if the obligation
is to a nonresident. International investment position is
described in Chapter 7.

keeping Conventions and the Micro-Macro Link,”
Review of Income and Wealth , Vol. 50, June

3.26 The accounting system underlying the inter-
national accounts derives from broad bookkeeping
principles. To understand the accounting system for
international accounts, three bookkeeping principles
can be distinguished:

(a) vertical double-entry bookkeeping (also known
in business accounting as simply double-entry
bookkeeping);
(b) horizontal double-entry bookkeeping; and
(c) quadruple-entry bookkeeping.
Vertical double-entry bookkeeping—
corresponding entries

3.27 The main characteristic of vertical double-entry
bookkeeping is that each transaction leads to at least
two corresponding entries, traditionally referred to as a
credit entry and a debit entry, in the books of the trans-
actor. The international accounts for an economy are
to be compiled on a vertical double-entry bookkeeping
basis from the perspective of the residents of that econ-
omy. Because each transaction is either an exchange or
a transfer, it requires two entries. This principle ensures
that the total of all credit entries and that of all debit
entries for all transactions are equal, thus permitting
a check on consistency of accounts for a single unit.
Reclassifications also lead to debit and credit entries.
Other flows have their corresponding entries directly in
changes in net worth. As a result, vertical double-entry
bookkeeping ensures the fundamental identity of a unit’s
balance sheet, that is, the total value of assets equals the
total value of liabilities plus net worth. The total value of
the assets owned by an entity minus the total value of lia-
bilities provides net worth. In the international accounts,
net international investment position provides a measure
of net financial claims with nonresidents plus gold bul-

lion held as monetary gold. These terms are discussed in
paragraphs 7.1–7.2.
Horizontal double-entry bookkeeping—
counterpart entries
3.28 The concept of horizontal double-entry book-
keeping is useful for compiling accounts that reflect the
mutual economic relationships between different insti-
tutional units in a consistent way. It means that if unit
A provides something to unit B, the accounts of both A
and B show the transaction for the same amount: as a
payment in A’s account and as a receipt in B’s account.
Horizontal double-entry bookkeeping ensures the con-
sistency of recording for each transaction category by
counterparties. For example, at the worldwide level,
dividends payable by all economies should be equal to
dividends receivable by all economies.
Quadruple-entry bookkeeping
3.29 The simultaneous application of both the verti-
cal and horizontal double-entry bookkeeping results in
a quadruple-entry bookkeeping, which is the account-
ing system underlying the recording of transactions
in the national accounts and international accounts.
Additionally, definitions, classifications, and account-
ing principles in the international accounts are derived
from the viewpoint of conceptual symmetry as well
as symmetric reporting by partner economies. The
quadruple-entry system deals in a coherent way with
multiple transactors or groups of transactors, each of
which practices vertical double-entry bookkeeping.
A single transaction between two counterparties thus
gives rise to four entries. In contrast to business book-
keeping, international accounts deal with interactions
among a multitude of units in parallel and thus require
special care from a consistency point of view. As a
liability of one unit is mirrored in a financial asset of
another unit, for instance, they should be identically
valued, allocated in time, and classified to avoid incon-
sistencies in aggregating balance sheets of units into
regional or global totals. The same is also true for all
transactions and other flows that affect balance sheets
of two counterparties. The quadruple approach to trans-
actions in the international accounts is needed for bilat-
eral comparisons and global integrated data.
Types of accounting entries
3.30 The international accounts use the following
conventions and terminologies for recording flows. In
the current and capital accounts, a credit denotes entries
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

from exports, primary income receivable, transfers
receivable, and disposals of nonproduced nonfinancial
assets. A debit is used to record entries for imports,
primary income payable, transfers payable, and acquisi-
tions of nonproduced nonfinancial assets.

3.31 In the case of transactions in financial assets and
liabilities, the terms “net acquisition of financial assets”
and “net incurrence of liabilities” are used. Financial
account items are recorded on a net basis separately
for each financial asset and liability (i.e., they reflect
changes due to all credit and debit entries during an
accounting period). The use of the terms “net acquisition
of financial assets” and “net incurrence of liabilities”
highlights the impact of the financial account on the
international investment position. The use of these terms
also simplifies the interpretation of data. A positive
change indicates an increase in assets or liabilities and a
negative change indicates a decrease in assets or liabili-
ties. The interpretation of increase or decrease under the
credit or debit notion, however, depends on whether the
increase or decrease refers to assets or liabilities (a debit
for an asset is an increase; a debit for a liability is a
decrease). Although the debit and credit presentation is
not emphasized for the financial account transactions, it
is important to recognize and maintain the accounting
identities. For example, a credit is always conceptually
matched with a corresponding debit, the latter relating to
either an increase in an asset or a reduction in a liability
(see Box 2.1). The conventions for aggregation, consoli-
dation, and netting assets against liabilities are described
in Section F.

3.32 Once a flow is identified, the time at which it
occurred must be determined so that the value of all
flows within a given accounting period can be com-
piled. The international accounts do not show indi-
vidual transactions or other flows, but there are several
reasons why precise rules on their individual timing

must be given. First, rules have to be formulated to
determine in which accounting period the discrete
flows are to be recorded. Second, an exact timing of
individual flows within the accounting period is crucial
to make the distinction between changes in net worth
due to transactions and those due to other changes (e.g.,
other changes in volume and revaluations). Third, the
integrated nature of the system means that the posi-
tions recorded on the balance sheet are influenced by
the timing of flows. Finally, the quadruple accounting
system requires that entries for a transaction are made
by the counterparties at the same time. This ensures the
consistency of accounts for each party (e.g., consistency
between the merchandise item and the corresponding
financial account entries) as well as the symmetry of
recording by partner economies.
3.33 One of the problems in determining the tim-
ing of transactions is that activities of institutional units
often stretch over periods in which several important
moments can be distinguished. For instance, exports and
imports of goods commence with the signing of a con-
tract between a seller and a buyer; encompass dates of
crossing borders, a date of delivery, and a date or dates
on which payments become due; and are completed only
when the last payment is received by the seller. Each
of these distinct moments in time is, to some extent,
economically relevant and may result in multiple trans-
actions in the international accounts. As explained in
the following paragraphs, each transaction should be
recorded according to the accrual basis, which deter-
mines the time period to which it shold be attributed.
1. Alternative recording bases

3.34 Broadly, the time of recording could be deter-
mined on four bases: the accrual basis, the due-for-
payment basis, the commitment basis, and the cash
basis. Other timing bases, such as physical movement
or administrative process, may be used in some data
sources. The accrual basis is used in the international
accounts as well as in other major macroeconomic sta-
tistical systems (e.g., national accounts, government
finance, and monetary and financial statistics).
3.35 Accrual accounting records flows at the time
economic value is created, transformed, exchanged,
transferred, or extinguished. This means that flows that
imply a change of economic ownership are recorded
when ownership passes and services are recorded when
provided. In other words, the effects of economic events
are recorded in the period in which they occur, irrespec-
tive of whether cash was received or paid or was due to
Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles
be received or paid. When an economic event is accom-
panied by a settlement at a later date, such as an import
of goods with trade credit, the time lag is bridged by
recording each event separately, the corresponding entry
at the time of import being trade credit payable.

3.36 A due-for-payment basis records flows that
give rise to cash payments at the time the payments
fall due. If a payment is made before it is due, then the
flows are recorded when the cash payment is made.

3.37 A commitment basis records flows when a unit
has committed itself to a transaction. Normally, this
basis may be envisaged only for acquisition of finan-
cial assets or incurrence of liabilities, and purchases of
goods, services, and labor inputs. The time of recording
generally is when a commitment is made or a purchase
order is issued.

3.38 A cash basis records flows when cash is received
or disbursed. In its strict form, only those flows that
involve cash as the medium of exchange are included.

2. Use of accrual basis in the international
accounts

3.39 The Manual recommends use of the accrual
basis for determining the time of recording of flows. The
accrual basis matches the time of recording with the tim-
ing of the events giving rise to the actual resource flows.
With the cash basis, the time of recording would poten-
tially diverge significantly from the time of the economic
activities and transactions to which the cash flows relate.
The due-for-payment basis would usually record transac-
tions after the resource flows have taken place, although
the long delays caused by the cash basis would, in most
cases, be reduced. The timing of the commitment basis
would precede the actual resource flows.

3.40 The accrual basis provides the most comprehen-
sive information because all resource flows are recorded,
including nonmonetary transactions, imputed transac-
tions, and other flows. Such a comprehensive recording
ensures the integration of flows and changes in balance
sheets. The accrual basis is consistent with the way
transactions, other flows, and main economic aggregates
(balance on goods and services, net lending / net borrow-
ing) are defined. It is also close to business accounting.

a. Time of recording of transactions

3.41 The change of economic ownership is central
in determining the time of recording on an accrual
basis for transactions in goods, nonproduced nonfinan-
cial assets, and financial assets. The term “economic

ownership” reflects the underlying reality economic
accounts are attempting to measure. Economic owner-
ship takes account of where the risks and rewards of
ownership lie. The concepts of economic ownership
and associated risks and rewards are further elaborated
in paragraph 5.3. A change in ownership from an eco-
nomic point of view means that all risks, rewards, and
rights and responsibilities of ownership in practice are
transferred. In general, a change in “legal ownership”
also involves a change in economic ownership. In some
cases, a change of “economic ownership” takes place
even though the “legal ownership” remains unchanged
(e.g., financial leases and transactions between an
enterprise and its foreign branches). In other cases,
there is no change in economic ownership, even though
there is a change in legal ownership. For example, for
repurchase agreements involving the provision of secu-
rities for cash, the risks and rewards attached to the
securities remain with the original holder (as discussed
in paragraphs 5.52–5.54) and the only transaction is a
loan. Similarly, in the case of securities lending without
cash collateral, there is no change in ownership of the
securities, although securities lending fees may arise
(see paragraphs 11.67–11.68).
3.42 Entries for transactions in goods, nonproduced
nonfinancial assets, and financial assets owned by insti-
tutional units are made at the time economic ownership
of the underlying asset is transferred. When a change in
economic ownership is not obvious, the change is con-
sidered to occur at (or is proxied by) the time the parties
to the transaction record it in their books or accounts.
3.43 General principles for applying the accrual basis
for time of recording to various flows are described in
paragraphs 3.44–3.66. More specific descriptions of the
accrual basis are detailed in relevant chapters.
Application to goods
3.44 Transactions in goods should be recorded as of
the time that the change of economic ownership takes
place. Goods are considered to change economic own-
ership when the parties enter the goods in their books
and make a corresponding change to their financial
assets and liabilities. For high-value capital goods such
as ships, heavy machinery, and other equipment, own-
ership changes are recorded at the time agreed between
the parties as to when ownership changes (see para-
graph 10.28). When a contract for building and other
construction is agreed in advance, progressive change
of ownership occurs for the work-in-progress, which
may take several months or years to complete. When
the contract calls for stage payments (progress pay-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

ments), the transaction values may often be approxi-
mated by the value of stage payments made each period
(see paragraphs 5.71 and 10.107). A difference in tim-
ing between the change of ownership and payments
may give rise to trade credit and advances.

3.45 The timing used in international merchandise
trade statistics generally follows customs procedures,
which are set up to record the movement of goods across
borders. The time at which goods cross the border can
be taken only as an approximation to the time when the
change of economic ownership occurs. A customs-based
collection system usually provides a choice of dates at
which transactions may be recorded (e.g., lodgment of
customs declaration, customs clearance of goods). The
time of recording in the international guidelines for mer-
chandise trade statistics is when the customs declaration
is lodged. Ideally, for international accounts purposes,
customs data should be adjusted (see paragraphs 3.61–
3.66). Likewise, an exchange record system that reflects
payments may not coincide in timing with the change in
economic ownership of the goods.

3.46 Goods on consignment (i.e., goods intended
for sale but not actually sold when the goods cross
the frontier) should be recorded only at the time eco-
nomic ownership changes. Goods under financial lease
arrangements are considered to change economic own-
ership at the inception of the lease (see paragraph 5.56
on the definition of a financial lease and paragraphs
7.57 and 10.17(f) for positions and transactions aris-
ing from financial leases). Goods sent abroad for pro-
cessing under the ownership of the same party are not
treated as if they change economic ownership. Goods
may move between a parent and its branch abroad.
In that case, possibilities exist that either the goods
have changed economic ownership or they may have
been sent for processing. The correct statistical treat-
ment is to identify which location assumes the risks and
rewards of ownership most strongly (e.g., from factors
such as whether the goods are included in the accounts,
and which location is responsible for subsequent sale
of the goods). For goods under merchanting, purchases
and resales are recorded at the time the change in eco-
nomic ownership of goods occurs.

Application to services
3.47 Transactions in services are recorded when
the services are provided. Some services, such as
some transport or hotel services, are provided within
a discrete period, in which cases, there is no problem
in determining the time of recording. Other services
are supplied or take place on a continuous basis. For

example, construction services, operating leasing, and
insurance services are recorded continuously as long
as they are being provided. When construction takes
place with a prior contract, the ownership of the struc-
ture is effectively transferred progressively as the work
proceeds. When services are provided over a period of
time, there may be advance payments or settlements
at later dates for such services (e.g., freight, insurance,
port services). The provision of services should be
recorded on an accrual basis in each accounting period
(i.e., they should be recorded as they are rendered, not
when payments are made). Entries for advance pay-
ments or settlements at later dates should be made in
the appropriate accounts when they occur (as explained
in paragraph 3.35 in the case of import of goods).
Application to primary income and transfers
3.48 Distributive transactions are recorded at the
moment the related claims arise. As a result, for exam-
ple, compensation of employees, interest, social con-
tributions and benefits are all recorded in the period
during which the amounts payable accrue. (See para-
graphs 11.20–11.21 for the recording of compensation
of employees associated with employee stock options.)
With respect to some distributive transactions, the time
of accrual depends on the unit’s decision as to when
to distribute primary income or make a transfer. Divi-
dends are recorded at the moment the shares go ex-
dividend. Three dates are associated with dividends:
(a) the date they are declared;
(b) the date they are excluded from the market price
of shares, known as the ex-dividend date. The
recipients of the dividends are determined from
the register of shareholders at this time and sub-
sequent shareholders do not have a right to the
dividends; and
(c) the date they are settled.
Although dividends sometimes may be related to the
enterprise’s profits in the previous period, in other
cases, they are only loosely related or not at all. The
price of shares includes declared dividends up to the
ex-dividend date, thus the holder of the shares before
the ex-dividend date owns the share and does not hold a
separate debt instrument reflecting declared and unpaid
dividends. Between the ex-dividend date and actual
settlement, the amount payable is recorded as other
accounts receivable/ payable. Withdrawals from income
of quasi-corporations, such as distributed branch prof-
its, are recorded when they actually take place. Rein-
vested earnings are derived from retained earnings,
Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles
and therefore they are recorded in the period in which
retained earnings accrue. (See paragraphs 11.33–11.47
for issues in the calculation of reinvested earnings.)

3.49 Interest is recorded as accruing on a continuous
basis because the financial resources are provided for
use on a continuous basis. For some financial instru-
ments, the debtor does not make any payments to the
creditor until the financial instrument matures, at which
time a single payment discharges the debtor’s liability;
the payment covers the amount of funds originally pro-
vided by the creditor and the interest accumulated over
the entire life of the financial instrument. Correspond-
ing entries to the interest accruing in each period before
maturity should be recorded as financial transactions
that represent an additional acquisition of the financial
asset by the creditor and an equal incurrence of a liabil-
ity by the debtor.

3.50 Taxes and other compulsory transfers should
be recorded when the activities, transactions, or other
events occur that create the government’s claim to the
taxes or other payments. In principle, income taxes
and social contributions based on income should be
attributed to the period in which the income is earned.
In practice, however, some flexibility may be needed
so that income taxes deducted at the source and regular
prepayments of income taxes may be recorded in the
periods in which they are paid, and any final tax liabil-
ity on income may be recorded in the period in which
it is determined.

3.51 Some compulsory transfers, such as fines,
penalties, and property forfeitures, are determined at
a specific time. These transfers are recorded when a
legal claim is established, which may occur when a
court renders judgment or an administrative ruling is
published.

3.52 Determining the time of recording for grants
and other voluntary transfers can be complex because
there is a wide variety of eligibility conditions that
have varying legal powers. In some cases, a potential
grant recipient has a legal claim when it has satis-
fied certain conditions, such as the prior incurrence
of expenses for a specific purpose or the passage of
legislation. These transfers are recorded when all
requirements and conditions are satisfied. In other
cases, the grant recipient never has a legal claim on
the donor, and the transfer should be attributed to the
time at which the settlement is made (e.g., cash pay-
ment). In general, the time of recording of voluntary
transfers is determined by the time at which there is
a change in the economic ownership of the resources

(such as goods, services, or financial assets) that are
corresponding entries to transfers.
Application to transactions in nonproduced
nonfinancial assets
3.53 Transactions in nonproduced nonfinancial
assets are recorded at the time economic ownership of
these assets changes. The treatment is similar to those
for goods and financial assets, as discussed in para-
graphs 3.44 and 3.54–3.55, respectively.
Application to transactions in financial assets
3.54 Transactions in financial assets (including
payments of cash) are recorded when economic own-
ership changes. Some financial assets, such as trade
credit, are the implicit result of a nonfinancial transac-
tion. In these cases, the financial claim is deemed to
arise at the time the corresponding nonfinancial trans-
action occurs. In some cases, the parties to a transac-
tion may perceive ownership to change on different
dates because they acquire the documents evidencing
the transaction at different times. This variation usually
is caused by the process of clearing, or the time checks
are in the mail. The amounts involved in such “float”
may be substantial in the case of transferable deposits
and other accounts receivable or payable. If no pre-
cise date can be fixed, the timing of the transaction is
determined according to the date on which the creditor
receives payment or some other financial claim.
3.55 Transactions in securities are recorded at the
time ownership changes, which determines the transac-
tion date. Both parties should record the transactions at
the time ownership changes, not when the underlying
financial asset is delivered. If settlement occurs after
the ownership has changed, this gives rise to accounts
receivable/payable. In practice, when the delay between
the transaction and settlement is short, the time of set-
tlement may be considered as an acceptable proxy, so
that accounts receivable/payable would not arise. In
cases of longer delays, however, accounts receivable/
payable should be identified.
3.56 According to the accrual basis, repayments of
debts are recorded when they are extinguished (such
as when they are paid, rescheduled, or forgiven by the
creditor). When arrears occur, no transactions should be
imputed, but the arrears should continue to be shown in
the same instrument until the liability is extinguished.
However, if the contract provided for a change in the
characteristics of a financial instrument when it goes
into arrears, this change should be recorded as a reclas-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

sification in the other changes in the financial assets
and liabilities account. The reclassification applies to
situations in which the original contract remains, but
the terms within it change (e.g., interest rates, repayment
periods). If the contract is renegotiated or the nature
of the instrument changes, as agreed between the par-
ties, from one instrument category to another (e.g., from
bonds to equity), the consequences are to be recorded as
new transactions. Consistent with the accrual principle,
an overdue obligation to settle a financial derivative con-
tract is not recorded as a transaction; however, the obli-
gation is reclassified to a debt liability because of the
change in the nature of the claim (see paragraph 5.82).

3.57 Data on arrears are important in their own right,
and thus should be presented as supplementary items,
where significant (or memorandum items in the case of
Exceptional Financing, see Appendix 1). Although it
is useful to identify some commonly important arrears
(such as arrears on public and publicly guaranteed
debt), flexibility is needed in determining which items
of arrears are important to disseminate, depending on
each economy’s circumstances. Arrears are described
further in paragraphs 5.99–5.102.

3.58 Activation of one-off (nonstandardized) guar-
antees gives rise to financial transactions because this
involves a creation of a new liability. The time of record-
ing of flows arising from activation of one-off guaran-
tees (including capital transfers and other changes in
the volume of assets, if applicable) is determined by the
occurrence of the events activating the guarantee. The
treatment of flows arising from the activation of one-
off guarantees is described in more detail in paragraphs
8.42–8.45.

3.59 Employee stock options are recognized at
grant date. Compensation of employees associated
with employee stock options should be recorded as
accruing over the period to which the option relates,
which generally is the period between the granting and
vesting dates. Sometimes, the options may cover the
period before the granting date, which should also be
taken into account when allocating the compensation
of employees.

b. Time of recording of other flows

3.60 Other flows include other changes in the vol-
ume of assets and revaluations. Other changes in the
volume of assets are usually discrete events that accrue
at precise moments or within fairly short periods of
time. Other changes in the volume of assets, includ-
ing reclassifications, are recorded as these changes

occur. Revaluations can occur continuously as prices
and exchange rates change. In practice, revaluations are
usually computed between two points in time at which
the relevant assets and liabilities are valued.
3. Timing adjustments
3.61 Differences in the time of recording by partner
economies may occur because of various factors. One of
the intrinsic problems in the international transactions
is the difference in time zones. Differences in time of
recording may arise from delays in mail deliveries or
settlement clearing processes. Several data sources may
often only approximate the required basis. It is important
to make timing adjustments in cases in which major
divergences occur from the required basis.
3.62 In choosing among available statistical sources,
compilers may wish to consider the advantage of using
data for which the correct timing is already recorded.
For example, records of actual drawings on loans are
preferable to sources that quote authorization dates or
program dates that may not be realized.
3.63 Timing adjustments to international merchan-
dise trade statistics may be necessary because these sta-
tistics may not reflect changes in economic ownership.
Moreover, they may not always reflect physical move-
ments correctly. Timing adjustments should be made
when practices in customs statistics lead to distortions.
For example, in the case of the purchase or sale of
ships and aircrafts, information on the time at which
the goods are entered in the books of the supplier or
customer could be used. It is a good practice to identify
the timing of large individual shipments or transactions
(such as a ship or aircraft) to ensure that the goods flow
and corresponding financing transactions are recorded
in the same period.
3.64 A change in the economic ownership of goods
can vary widely from the time at which the goods are
recorded in trade statistics, if a lengthy voyage is
part of the process of importing or exporting. If the
unit value of trade changes substantially from the
beginning to the end of the reporting period, the pos-
sible difference of one or more months between the
shipment or receipt of goods and the change of own-
ership can be a source of error in the statement for
a particular economy and a source of asymmetries
between partner economies. Inquiries, perhaps on a
sample basis, are required to ascertain specific prac-
tices, and timing adjustments should, in principle, be
applied to correct the trade statistics for those classes
of goods that are found to change ownership at times

Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles
other than those at which the goods were recorded in
the trade statistics.

3.65 Goods on consignment may often be recorded at
the time the goods cross the frontier, on the assumption
that a change of ownership has occurred or will shortly
occur. If that treatment is followed and there is no change
of ownership, adjustments will have to be made, prefer-
ably by revising the original entries. In practice, these
adjustments may be made in the periods when the goods
are returned, if goods returned involve minor cases.

3.66 Information based on exchange records pro-
vides data on a cash basis. For certain transactions,
cash and accrual bases for recording may be the same,
but for many they will differ. In particular, transactions
in goods, services, and income may not coincide with
the corresponding payments for settling the transac-
tions. Alternative information should be used routinely
to verify or adjust selected transaction categories. Com-
pilers using an exchange record system should check
each large settlement transaction. Information on inter-
est from either the payments records or debt service
schedule may not be appropriate for accrual account-
ing. Other possibilities of deriving interest accrual, such
as using the data on positions and contractual interest
rates, should be explored and implemented.

3.67 Market prices refer to current exchange
value, that is, the values at which goods and other
assets, services, and labors are exchanged or else
could be exchanged for cash. Market prices are the
basis for valuation in the international accounts. This
section describes the general principles for valuation
of flows and positions. Valuation of specific types of
flows and positions are discussed in further detail in
relevant chapters.

1. Valuation of transactions

3.68 Market prices for transactions are defined as
amounts of money that willing buyers pay to acquire

something from willing sellers ; the exchanges are
made between independent parties and on the basis of
commercial considerations only—sometimes called
“at arm’s length.” Thus, according to this strict defi-
nition, a market price refers only to the price for one
specific exchange under the stated conditions. A sec-
ond exchange of an identical unit, even under circum-
stances that are almost exactly the same, could result
in a different market price. A market price defined in
this way is to be clearly distinguished from a price
quoted in the market, a world market price, a going
price, a fair market price, or any price that is intended
to express the generality of prices for a class of sup-
posedly identical exchanges rather than a price actu-
ally applying to a specific exchange. Furthermore,
a market price should not necessarily be construed
as equivalent to a free market price—that is, a mar-
ket transaction should not be interpreted as occurring
exclusively in a purely competitive market situation.
In fact, a market transaction could take place in a
monopolistic, monopsonistic, or any other market
structure. Indeed, the market may be so narrow that
it consists of the sole transaction of its kind between
independent parties.
3.69 Actual exchange values in the contract between
two parties in most cases will represent market prices
as described in the preceding paragraph, regardless
of taxes and subsidies. Paragraphs 3.77–3.79 describe
cases in which actual exchange values do not represent
market prices. Transactions that involve dumping and
discounting represent market prices. Market price is
the price payable by the buyer after taking into account
any rebates, refunds, adjustments, and so on from the
seller. Imports and exports of general merchandise are
recorded at FOB values, which take into account any
export taxes payable or any tax rebates receivable.
3.70 Transactions in financial assets and liabili-
ties are recorded according to the general principles
described in paragraph 3.68. In particular, transac-
tions in loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/
payable also should be valued at market prices. Trans-
actions in financial assets and liabilities should be
recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, and taxes
whether charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s
price, or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. This is
because both debtors and creditors should record the
same amount for the transaction in the same financial
instrument. The commissions, fees, and taxes should be
recorded separately from the transaction in the finan-
cial asset and liability, under appropriate categories.
The valuation of transactions in financial instruments,
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

which excludes commission charges (recorded as trans-
actions in services), differs from the valuation of nonfi-
nancial asset transactions, which includes any costs of
ownership transfer unless paid separately.

3.71 When market prices for transactions are not
observable, valuation according to market-equivalent
prices provides approximation to market prices. In such
cases, market prices of the same or similar items when
such prices exist will provide a good basis for applying
the principle of market prices. Generally, market prices
should be taken from the markets in which the same or
similar items are traded currently in sufficient numbers
and in similar circumstances. If there is no appropriate
market in which a particular good or service is cur-
rently traded, the valuation of a transaction involving
that good or service may be derived from the market
prices of similar goods and services by making adjust-
ments for quality and other differences.

3.72 Some cases in which market prices are not avail-
able or pose specific problems include barter transac-
tions, provision of goods and services without a charge,
and goods under financial lease. If a buyer and a seller
engage in a barter transaction—the exchange of goods
or services for other goods, services, or assets (of equal
value)—the goods or services bartered should be valued
at the prices that would have been received if the goods
or services had been sold in the market. Similarly, a
grant and donation in kind can be valued using the mar-
ket price of the goods or services at the time of transfer.
Cost of acquisition also may be used in certain situa-
tions, particularly when there is no time lag between the
acquisition and the transfer. Acquisition of goods under
financial lease should be valued at market prices at the
time of acquisition, if such prices are available. When no
price is determined, it may be necessary to use the esti-
mated written-down current acquisition values of fixed
assets or the present value of expected future returns.

3.73 Market valuation also poses problems for trans-
actions in goods in which the contracts establish a quota-
tion period often months after the goods have changed
hands. In such cases, market value at the time of change of
ownership should be estimated, which should be revised
with the actual market value, when known. Market value
is given by the contract price regardless of whether it is
unknown at the time of change of ownership.

3.74 Values of imputed transactions will have to be
derived from values of other observed transactions to
which they are related. For example, values of transac-
tions in reinvested earnings are derived from the direct
investors’ shares in the net saving of the direct invest-

ment enterprise before reinvested earnings are distrib-
uted. Reinvested earnings and the recording of related
financial account entries are described in paragraphs
8.15–8.16 and 11.33–11.47.
3.75 When nonfinancial resources are provided,
without a quid pro quo, to nonresidents by the govern-
ment or private nonprofit institutions of an economy,
the same values must be reflected in the international
accounts of both recipient and donor. In conformity with
the general principles, such resources should be valued
at the market prices that would have been received if
the resources had been sold in the market. The donor’s
view of the imputed value of the transaction may be
quite different from that of the recipient. The suggested
rule of thumb is to use the value assigned by the donor
as a basis for recording.
3.76 In some cases, actual exchange values may
not represent market prices. Examples are transac-
tions involving the following: transfer pricing between
affiliated enterprises; manipulative agreements with
third parties; and certain noncommercial transactions,
including concessional interest. Prices may be under- or
overinvoiced (i.e., shown at a price other than the actual
price, for instance, to evade taxes or exchange controls),
in which case, an assessment of a market-equivalent
value needs to be made. An adjustment should be made
when actual exchange values do not represent market
prices, but this may not be practical in many cases.
Adjusting the actual exchange values to reflect market
prices will have consequences in other accounts. There-
fore, when such adjustments are made, corresponding
adjustments in other accounts also should be made;
for example, if prices of goods are adjusted, associated
income account or financial account transactions also
should be adjusted.
3.77 Transfer pricing refers to the valuation of trans-
actions between affiliated enterprises. In some cases,
transfer pricing may be motivated by income distribu-
tion or equity buildups or withdrawals. Replacing book
values (transfer prices) with market-equivalent values
is desirable, in principle, when the distortions are large
and when availability of data (such as adjustments by
customs or tax officials or from partner economies)
makes it feasible to do so. Selection of the best market-
equivalent values to replace book values is an exercise
calling for cautious and informed judgment. The treat-
ment of transfer pricing between affiliated enterprises
is elaborated in paragraphs 11.101–11.102.
3.78 The exchange of goods between affiliated enter-
prises often may be one that does not occur between
Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles
independent parties (e.g., specialized components that
are usable only when incorporated in a finished prod-
uct). Similarly, the exchange of services, such as man-
agement services and technical know-how, may have no
near equivalents in the types of transactions in services
that usually take place between independent parties.
Thus, for transactions between affiliated parties, the
determination of values comparable to market values
may be difficult, and compilers may have no choice
other than to accept valuations based on explicit costs
incurred in production or any other values assigned by
the enterprise. The valuation of management fees and
other similar cases is elaborated in paragraph 10.150.

3.79 Some noncommercial transactions, such as a
grant in kind, have no market price; however, other
noncommercial transactions may take place at implied
prices that include some element of grant or concession,
so that those prices also are not market prices. Examples
of such transactions could include negotiated exchanges
of goods between governments and government loans
bearing lower interest rates than those with similar
grace and repayment periods or other terms for purely
commercial loans. Concessional lending is described
in paragraph 12.51. In principle, an adjustment should
be made, although this may not be practical in many
cases, to record these transactions at market prices and
a transfer is recorded for the difference between the
implied price and the market price. Transactions by
general government bodies and private nonprofit enti-
ties not engaged in purely commercial undertakings are
often subject to noncommercial considerations. Trans-
fers involving the provision of goods and services also
may be provided or received, however, by other sectors
of the economy.

3.80 In cases in which a single exchange value
reflects more than one transaction category, the trans-
actions captured in the single exchange need to be par-
titioned (unbundled) into individual transactions, as
described in paragraph 3.17. In that case, the total value
of the partitioned individual transactions must equal the
market value of the exchange that actually occurred.
For example, actual exchange values involving foreign
currency may include commission for currency conver-
sion. Any portion related to currency conversion should
be recorded separately as transactions in services.

2. Valuation of other flows

3.81 Other flows in the international accounts cap-
ture changes in the international investment position of
financial assets and liabilities that are not due to trans-
actions. Holding gains and losses arise from changes in

market values of positions of financial assets and liabili-
ties. Holding gains and losses may accrue continuously.
A holding gain occurs when an asset increases in value
or a liability decreases in value; a holding loss occurs
when an asset decreases in value or a liability increases
in value. The value of holding gains and losses dur-
ing an accounting period shows net holding gains or
losses for assets and liabilities separately. In practice,
the value of holding gains and losses are calculated for
each asset and liability between two points in time: the
beginning of the period (or when the asset or liability
is acquired or incurred) and the end of the period (or
when the asset or liability is sold or extinguished).
3.82 For loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/
payable sold at a discount, the transaction values recorded
in the financial account may differ from the nominal val-
ues recorded in the international investment position. Such
differences are recorded as valuation changes in the other
changes in financial assets and liabilities account (see also
paragraph 9.33).
3.83 Other changes in the volume of financial assets
and liabilities are recorded at the market-equivalent
prices of similar instruments. When writing off finan-
cial instruments that are valued at nominal values, the
value recorded in the other changes in financial assets
and liabilities account should correspond to their nomi-
nal value prior to being written off. For all reclassifica-
tions of assets and liabilities, values of both the new
and old instruments should be the same.
3. Valuation of positions of financial assets and
liabilities

Reference:
IMF, Monetary and Financial Statistics Compilation
Guide , paragraphs 2.42–2.67.
3.84 Positions of financial assets and liabilities
should, in general, be valued as if they were acquired
in market transactions on the balance sheet reporting
date. Many financial assets are traded in markets on a
regular basis and therefore can be valued by directly
using the price quotations from these markets. If the
financial markets are closed on the balance sheet date,
the market prices that should be used in the valuation
are those that prevailed on the closest preceding date
when the markets were open. Debt securities have a
current market value as well as a nominal value, and
for some purposes, supplementary data on the nominal
values of positions of debt securities may be useful (see
paragraph 3.88 for definition of nominal value).
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

3.85 Valuation according to the market-value equiv-
alent is needed for valuing financial assets and liabili-
ties that are not traded in financial markets or that are
traded only infrequently. For these assets and liabili-
ties, it will be necessary to estimate fair values that, in
effect, approximate market prices. The present value of
future cash flows also may be used as an approximation
to market prices, provided an appropriate discount rate
can be used.

3.86 Loan positions are recorded at nominal value.
The use of nominal values is partly influenced by prag-
matic concerns about data availability and the need to
maintain symmetry between debtors and creditors. In
addition, because loans are not intended for negotia-
bility, without an active market, estimating a market
price can be somewhat subjective. Nominal value is
also useful because it shows actual legal liability and
the starting point of creditor recovery behavior. In some
instances, loans also may be traded, often at discount,
or a fair value may exist or would be possible to esti-
mate. It is recognized that nominal value provides an
incomplete view of the financial position, particularly
when the loans are nonperforming. Therefore, infor-
mation on the nominal value of nonperforming loans
should be included as a memorandum or supplementary
item (see paragraph 7.50 for the definition of nonper-
forming loans). Loans that have become negotiable de
facto should be reclassified under debt securities (see
paragraph 5.45 for criteria for reclassification).

3.87 Positions on deposits and accounts receivable/
payable are also recorded at nominal value. They give
rise to the same issues of nominal and fair values as
loans. Deposits at banks and other deposit-taking cor-
porations in liquidation also should be recorded at their
nominal value until they are written off. If significant,
however, such deposits should be shown separately as a
supplementary item. The same treatment is applicable
for any other cases of impaired deposits (i.e., where the
deposit-taking corporation is not in liquidation but is
insolvent).

3.88 Market values, fair values, and nominal values
should be distinguished from such notions as amortized
values, face values, book values, and historic cost.

(a) Fair value is a market-equivalent value. It is
defined as the amount for which an asset could
be exchanged, or a liability settled, between
knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-
length transaction. It thus represents an estimate
of what could be obtained if the creditor had sold
the financial claim.
(b) Nominal value refers to the outstanding amount
the debtor owes to the creditor, which is com-
posed of the outstanding principal amount
including any accrued interest. So the nomi-
nal value reflects the sum of funds originally
advanced, plus any subsequent advances, plus
any interest that has accrued, less any repay-
ments (which includes any payments covering
interest accrual).^4 Nominal value in domestic
currency of a debt instrument denominated in
foreign currency also includes holding gains or
losses arising from exchange rate changes.
(c) Amortized value of a loan reflects the process
of gradual elimination of the liability by regular
payments over a specified period of time. On
the date of each scheduled payment, amortized
value is the same as nominal value, but it may
differ from the nominal value on other dates
because nominal value includes interest that has
accrued and not been paid.
(d) Face value is t he und iscounted a mount to be pa id
to the holder at maturity. It is also known as “par
value” or simply “par.” Before maturity, the mar-
ket value of a bond may be greater or less than
face value, depending on the interest rate pay-
able and the perceived risk of default. As bonds
approach maturity, market value approaches face
value. For example, if interest rates are higher
than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold
at a discount (below par). Conversely, if interest
rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate, then
the bond is sold at a premium (above par).
(e) Book value in business accounts generally refers
to the value recorded in the enterprise’s records.
Book values may have different meanings
because their values are influenced by the timing
of acquisition, company takeovers, frequency of
revaluations, and tax and other regulations.
(f) Historic cost , in its strict sense, reflects the cost
at the time of acquisition, but sometimes it also
may reflect occasional revaluations.
3.89 The valuation of financial assets and liabilities
in data reported by enterprises or other respondents
may be based on commercial, supervisory, tax, or other
(^4) For debt instruments indexed to a “narrow” index, the nominal
value can also include holding gains and losses arising from move-
ments in the index (see paragraph 11.61(b)). For further detail on
nominal value, see External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers
and Users.
Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles

accounting standards that do not fully reflect the mar-
ket prices of the assets and liabilities. In such cases, the
data should be adjusted to ref lect, as closely as possible,
the market value of the financial assets and liabilities
except when they are to be recorded at nominal values
(see paragraphs 3.86–3.87).

3.90 When securities are quoted on markets with
a buy-sell spread, the midpoint should be used to
value the instrument. The spread is an implicit ser-
vice of the dealer, paid by buyers and sellers (see
paragraphs 10.122–10.123). Similarly, positions in
financial assets and liabilities denominated in for-
eign currency should be valued using the midpoint
at close of business between the buying and selling
rates on the reference date.

3.91 Specific cases of valuation of positions of finan-
cial assets and liabilities, particularly when market
prices are not available or pose problems, are discussed
in Chapter 7, International Investment Position.

4. Unit of account and currency conversion

a. Unit of account

3.92 Values of nonfinancial and financial transac-
tions as well as the values of positions of financial
assets and liabilities may be expressed initially in a
variety of currencies or in other standards of value,
such as Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). The conver-
sion of these values into a reference unit of account is a
requisite for the construction of consistent and analyti-
cally meaningful accounts.

3.93 International accounts can be compiled in the
domestic currency as well as in another currency. Data
in domestic currency are needed because several other
macroeconomic and micro data are compiled in domestic
currency, except when a foreign currency is used as a legal
tender. Economic analysis often uses data from several
macroeconomic statistical systems. Conversely, data in
an international unit of account (a foreign currency) may
be needed for international liquidity management and
to address special issues for high inflation, significant
exchange rate fluctuations, and multiple exchange rates.
In addition, a standard or international unit of account is
necessary to allow for aggregation on a global or regional
basis and to facilitate international comparisons.

3.94 From the international perspective, a standard
unit of account is required for global presentation and
analysis. It is preferable that the unit of account be a
stable one; that is, values of international transactions
expressed in that unit should not be significantly affected

by changes (relative to the unit of account) in values of
currencies in which those transactions occur. Transac-
tions expressed in a unit that is stable in this sense none-
theless may reflect price changes resulting from other
causes; that is, a series expressed in a so-called stable
unit of account is not the equivalent of a volume measure
or constant price series. The theoretical ideal of a widely
recognized and perfectly stable standard unit of account
simply does not exist in practice.
b. Domestic versus foreign currency
3.95 For an economy, a domestic currency is distin-
guished from foreign currency. Domestic currency is
that which is legal tender in the economy and issued by
the monetary authority for that economy; that is, either
that of an individual economy or, in a currency union,
that of the common currency area to which the economy
belongs. All other currencies are foreign currencies.
3.96 Under this definition, an economy that uses as
its legal tender a currency issued by a monetary author-
ity of another economy—such as U.S. dollars—or of
a common currency area to which it does not belong
should classify the currency as a foreign currency, even
if domestic transactions are settled in this currency.
The term “currency” should be understood in the broad
sense (i.e., currency includes not only banknotes and
coins but all means of payments issued by financial
institutions in an economic territory). Unallocated gold
accounts and other unallocated accounts in precious
metals giving title to claim the delivery of gold or pre-
cious metal are treated as denominated in foreign cur-
rency. The treatment of unallocated accounts in other
commodities will need to be decided at the time such
cases arise in the future.
3.97 SDRs are considered to be foreign currency
in all cases, including for the economies that issue the
currencies in the SDR basket. Any other currency units
issued by an international organization, except in the
context of a currency union (see paragraph 3.95), are
considered foreign currency.
c. Currency of denomination and currency of
settlement
3.98 A distinction should be made between the cur-
rency of denomination and the currency of settlement.
The currency of denomination is determined by the cur-
rency in which the value of flows and positions is fixed
as specified in the contract between the parties. Accord-
ingly, all cash flows are determined using the currency
of denomination and, if necessary, converted into the
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

domestic currency or another unit of account for the
purpose of settlement or compilation of accounts. The
currency of denomination is important for distinguishing
transaction values and holding gains and losses.

3.99 The currency of settlement may be different
from the currency of denomination. Using a currency
in settlement that is different from the currency of
denomination simply means that a currency conversion
is involved each time a settlement occurs. The currency
of settlement is important for international liquidity
and measurement of potential foreign exchange drains.
The currency of settlement is also important for defin-
ing reserve assets (see paragraph 6.64).

3.100 The currency of denomination of equity and
investment fund shares is generally the domestic cur-
rency of the economy in which the issuer is resident.
However, when equity is issued in a currency other
than the domestic currency, then that currency is the
currency of denomination.

3.101 Debt instruments with both the amount to
be paid at maturity and all periodic payments (such
as coupons) indexed to a foreign currency are classi-
fied and treated in the international accounts as being
denominated in that foreign currency.

3.102 Some financial assets and liabilities are
denominated in more than one currency. However, if
the amounts payable are linked to one specific cur-
rency, then the liability should be attributed to that
currency. Otherwise, compilers are encouraged to dis-
aggregate such multicurrency instruments by the com-
ponent currencies.

3.103 Determining the currency of denomination
is not always clear in financial derivative contracts to
purchase or sell foreign currency using domestic cur-
rency. The decisive factor in determining the currency
of denomination for these contracts is the exposure
to currency movements. If settlement of a financial
derivative contract is linked to a foreign currency, even
though payment is required in domestic currency, then
the financial derivative is to be classified as denomi-
nated in foreign currency.

d. Currency conversion principles

3.104 Flows denominated in a foreign currency are
converted to their value in the domestic currency at the
rate prevailing when the flows take place, and posi-
tions are converted at the rate prevailing on the balance
sheet date. The midpoint between the buying and sell-
ing rates should be used at the time of transaction (for

transactions) and at the close of business on the refer-
ence date for positions.^5 The valuation in the domestic
currency of a purchase or sale on credit denominated in
a foreign currency may differ from the value in domes-
tic currency of the subsequent cash payment because
the exchange rate changed in the interim. Both transac-
tions should be valued at their current market values as
of the dates they actually occurred, and a holding gain
or loss resulting from the change in the exchange rate
should be recorded for the period or periods in which
the gain or loss occurs.
3.105 In principle, the actual exchange rate appli-
cable to each transaction should be used for currency
conversion. The use of a daily average exchange rate for
daily transactions usually provides a good approxima-
tion. If daily rates cannot be applied, average rates for
the shortest period should be used. Some transactions
occur on a continuous basis, such as the accrual of
interest over a period of time. For such flows, therefore,
an average exchange rate for the period in which the
flows occur should be used for currency conversion.
3.106 Derived measures (see Section H for the
definition of derived measures) relating to a period
are calculated by subtracting one type of flow from
another. In principle, therefore, derived measures of
flows in one currency (e.g., domestic currency) should
not be directly converted into another currency (e.g.,
foreign currency). First, the underlying flows them-
selves should be converted from the domestic currency
into the foreign currency. Then, the derived measures
in foreign currency can be calculated from the relevant
flows denominated in foreign currency. It is possible
that a derived measure, such as the current account
balance, denominated in one currency may be different
or even with the opposite sign from that denominated
in another currency. In addition to the variations in
exchange rates, the variations in the timing of underly-
ing flows cause the differences in a derived measure
denominated in different currencies.
3.107 Under a multiple exchange rate regime, two
or more exchange rates are applicable to different cat-
egories of transactions; the rates favor some categories
and discourage others. Such rates incorporate elements
similar to taxes or subsidies. Because the multiple rates
influence the values and the undertaking of transac-
tions expressed in domestic currency, net proceeds
implicitly accruing to authorities as a result of these
transactions are calculated as implicit taxes or subsi-
(^5) The difference between buying or selling prices and midpoint
prices represents a service charge (see paragraphs 10.122–10.123).
Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles

dies. The amount of the implicit tax or subsidy for each
transaction can be calculated as the difference between
the value of the transaction in domestic currency at
the actual exchange rate applicable and the value of
the transaction at a unitary rate that is calculated as a
weighted average of all official rates used for external
transactions. For conversion of positions of external
financial assets and liabilities in a multiple rate system,
the actual exchange rate applicable to specific assets
or liabilities at the beginning or end of the accounting
period is used.

3.108 Parallel (unofficial) or black market rates
cannot be ignored in the context of a multiple rate
regime and can be treated in different ways. For
instance, if there is one official rate and a parallel
market rate, the two should be handled separately.
Transactions in parallel markets should be converted
using the exchange rate applicable in that market. If
there are multiple official rates and a parallel rate, the
official rates and the parallel rate should be treated
as distinct markets in any calculation of a unitary
rate. Transactions effected at the parallel rate usually
should be converted separately at that rate. In some
instances, however, parallel markets may be consid-
ered effectively integrated with the official exchange
rate regime. Such is the case when most or all trans-
actions in the parallel market are sanctioned by the
authorities or when the authorities actively intervene in
the market to affect the parallel rate. In this instance,
the calculation of the unitary rate should include both
the official and parallel market rates. If only limited
transactions in the parallel market are sanctioned by
the authorities, the parallel rate should not be included
in the calculation of a unitary rate.

F. Aggregation and Netting
3.109 Transactions, other flows, and positions of
external financial assets and liabilities are presented
in the international accounts by grouping them into
several analytically meaningful categories. The clas-
sification of transactions, other flows, and positions of
financial assets and liabilities is aimed at developing
aggregates that group similar items and separate those
items that have different characteristics. Aggregates
and classifications are closely linked in that classifica-
tions are designed to produce the aggregates thought to
be most useful.

3.110 Aggregates are summations of elementary
items in a class of transactions, other flows, or posi-
tions. For example, compensation of employees is the

sum of all flows that are classified as compensation
of employees. For financial assets and liabilities, the
aggregation of position or flow data is usually done
across all institutional units within a subsector or sec-
tor. Aggregation is hierarchical in the sense that upper-
level aggregates are derived directly by summing the
lower-level aggregates.
3.111 Individual units may have the same kind of
transaction both as a credit and a debit—for exam-
ple, they may pay as well as receive interest or may
acquire foreign currency as well as sell the foreign
currency. Similarly, individual units may have the
same kind of financial instrument both as an asset
and as a liability—for example, they may have a
claim in the form of debt securities as well as a
liability in the form of debt securities.
3.112 Aggregations or combinations in which all
elementary items are shown for their full values are
called gross recordings (e.g., all interest credits are
aggregated separately from all interest debits). Aggre-
gations or combinations for which the values of some
elementary items are offset against the same items that
have an opposite sign are called net recordings (e.g.,
acquisitions of foreign currency are netted against the
sales of the foreign currency).
3.113 The international accounts follow gross
recording in the current and capital accounts. For goods
under merchanting, both purchases and resales of
goods are shown on a gross basis, although both entries
are shown under exports with a negative sign for pur-
chases (this is elaborated further in paragraph 10.44).
Gross recording is applicable in particular to income on
reverse investment where the direct investment enter-
prise owns less than 10 percent of the voting power
in the direct investor (reverse investment is described
in paragraphs 6.39–6.40). Acquisitions and disposals
of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets are recorded on a
gross basis. Capital transfers receivables and payables
are also recorded separately on a gross basis. Flows on
transactions in nonproduced, nonfinancial assets and
capital transfers are recorded on a gross basis, because
they are important in the context of cross-border analy-
sis. At the same time, the gross recording allows the
derivation of net flows, if needed, provided that a suf-
ficient level of detail is available.
3.114 In the case of flows in financial assets and liabil-
ities, the term “net” may have dual meanings (summing
all debits and credits for a financial asset type or a liability
type and netting of an asset against a liability). To avoid
confusion, this Manual adopts the following conventions:
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

(a) In the case of flows, “net recording” always
refers to aggregations for which all debit entries
of a particular asset or a particular liability are
netted against all credit entries in the same asset
type or in the same liability type (e.g., acquisi-
tions of foreign currency are netted against the
sales of the foreign currency; bond issues are
netted against redemption of bonds).
(b) When net is used together with a category of
financial instrument (net financial instrument ),
such as “net financial derivatives,” netting of a
financial asset against the same type of liability
is understood.
(c) Title of some derived measures also uses the
term “net.” They are “net lending/borrowing”
and “net international investment position.”
3.115 The international accounts follow net record-
ing in the financial account and other changes in finan-
cial assets and liabilities account. Net recording, as
explained above, means aggregations or combinations
that show net changes (increases less reductions) in a
particular financial asset or a liability category on the
same side of the balance sheet. Financial assets (changes
in financial assets) should not be netted against liabili-
ties (changes in liabilities), except in certain circum-
stances as explained in paragraph 3.118.

3.116 Transactions and other flows in financial assets
and liabilities are recorded as net changes in financial
assets and net changes in liabilities, respectively. The
net recording principle should be applied at the lowest
level of classification of financial instruments taking
into account the functional, institutional sector, maturity,
and currency classifications, as applicable. Generally, the
net recording principle should be applied within a given
standard component of assets or liabilities.

3.117 In general, net recording of flows in financial
assets and liabilities are recommended in the inter-
national accounts from both the analytical and prag-
matic perspectives. Net acquisition of external financial
claims and net incurrence of external liabilities are
generally of more analytical interest than the gross
flows. Gross reporting of data may not be possible
for different classes of units and for some financial
instruments. Furthermore, transactions in some finan-
cial assets and liabilities often have to be derived from
balance sheet data because gross transactions are not
available. Nonetheless, gross flows may be a relevant
factor in analyzing aspects of the payments positions
or financial markets (e.g., securities transactions) of
economies, and such data can be used in supplementary

presentations when appropriate. For example, for direct
investment, equity increases and equity decreases may
be of analytical interest and may be shown separately
in supplementary presentations.
3.118 In some cases, a clear distinction between
assets and liabilities may not be feasible (such as for
financial derivatives in the form of forward contracts,
which could change between assets and liabilities).
In such cases, it may not be possible to apply the net
recording principle, which requires separate presenta-
tion of transactions in assets and transactions in liabili-
ties. For such financial instruments, net transactions in
assets and liabilities combined may have to be recorded
in the international accounts.
3.119 Positions of financial assets and liabilities are
recorded on a gross basis. Positions of the same type
of a financial instrument held as both a financial asset
and a liability are to be presented gross, so that assets
are recorded under assets and liabilities are recorded
under liabilities. For example, holding of short-term
debt securities as assets is presented separately from
the liability for short-term debt securities. For financial
derivatives, see also paragraph 6.60.
3.120 Consolidation is a method of presenting
statistics for a set of units as if they constituted a
single unit. Because the international accounts reflect
transactions involving residents and nonresidents and
external financial assets and liabilities, including
other flows associated with them, consolidation is not
relevant for international accounts of an individual
economy.
3.121 International accounts for a currency union,
economic union, or other regional arrangement may
be compiled by eliminating all transactions and asset-
liability relationships that occur between member econ-
omies of the region. In other words, in the international
accounts, a transaction of one economy is paired with the
same transaction as recorded for another member econ-
omy and both transactions are eliminated. For example,
if a unit in one economy owns a bond issued by a unit
in another member economy, then the stocks of bonds
held as assets and liabilities are reported excluding the
matched positions between the units of the member
economies. At the same time, interest receivable and
payable consolidated at the regional or currency union
level exclude the interest payable by residents of the
debtor economy to residents of the creditor economy in
the region or currency union. Similarly, sales of goods
and services between consolidated economies are also
eliminated. (For further information, see Appendix 3,
Chapter 3 g Accounting Principles
Regional Arrangements: Currency Unions, Economic
Unions, and Other Regional Statements.)

G. Symmetry of Reporting
3.122 Symmetry of reporting by counterparties
is important to ensure consistency, comparability,
and analytical usefulness of international accounts.
The quadruple-entry accounting system discussed in
paragraph 3.29 underlies symmetry of reporting. The
internationally agreed guidelines for definitions, clas-
sifications, time of recording and valuation principles,
and the quadruple-entry accounting system provide a
basis for conceptual consistency of reporting by both
parties or economies involved in a transaction or finan-
cial position. Correct application of these guidelines
and principles is important for bilateral comparisons,
global balances, and regional and global aggregates.
While symmetry rules apply to all financial instru-
ments, they do not fully apply to functional categories
of financial positions and transactions. For example,
transactions and positions in reserve assets are reflected
in the liabilities of counterparts in the rest of the world
under other functional categories, particularly portfolio
and other investment.

3.123 International accounts group the flow and posi-
tion data of individual units into sectoral and national
aggregates. International accounts also can be prepared
for a region and the world as a whole. Without apply-
ing strict consistency rules, it would be impossible to
give proper interpretation to various aggregates. These
requirements apply whether or not the data consolidate
flows and positions of the units they cover, and whether
or not they show any subgroups of units within the
overall total. However, consolidation is clearly impos-
sible without consistency in the basic data, and the
requirements of consistency are more obvious when
disaggregation of sectors is used.

3.124 Micro-level data on the basis of which the
international accounts are compiled do not necessarily
meet the consistency requirements needed for interna-
tional accounts. Differences in valuation, timing, and
classification may occur in many cases. Inconsistency
in valuation may often occur for barter transactions.
Different valuation bases may have been used by credi-
tors and debtors for some financial assets, such as non-
performing loans. Timing differences may occur not
only due to differences in timing zones and delays in
check-clearing systems, but also because units’ percep-
tions of the timing of changes in ownership and recog-
nition of revenues and expenses may vary.

3.125 Significant achievements have been made at
the national and international levels to come to more
uniform business accounting standards. Accordingly,
disparities between individual micro accounts have
tended to fall. Business accounting standards are geared
toward individual accounts, however, and therefore do
not necessarily ensure interunit consistency. Current
business accounting standards prescribe that loans be
treated differently depending on whether they appear
as a credit or a debit. This approach cannot be applied
in a consistent horizontal double-entry bookkeeping
system. Tax and supervisory regulations are a second
source for harmonization of accounting practices. In so
far as these rules differentiate between specific sections
of the economy, however, they also may be a cause for
discrepancies between micro accounts.
H. Derived Measures
3.126 Derived measures are not transactions or other
flows. They are economic constructs that are calculated
by subtracting one or more aggregates from one or
more other aggregates. They are important analytical
tools that summarize the values of selected flows or
stocks that have been individually recorded in the inter-
national accounts.
3.127 A derived measure cannot be obtained inde-
pendently of the other entries; as a derived entry, it
reflects the application of the general accounting rules
to the specific entries from which it is derived. Some
derived measures are essentially balancing items,
because they are obtained by subtracting the total value
of the entries on one side of an account from the total
value for the other side (e.g., net international invest-
ment position is equal to total external financial assets
minus total external liabilities).
3.128 Derived measures encapsulate a great deal of
information and include some of the most important
entries in the international accounts. However, they are
best understood and more analytically useful if consid-
ered together with the aggregates from which they are
derived.
3.129 Some important measures derived as balances
in the international accounts are as follows:
Balance on trade in goods;
Balance on trade in services;
Balance on goods and services;
Balance on goods, services, and primary income;
current account balance;
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Net lending / net borrowing:
from current and capital accounts;
from financial account;
Changes in net IIP arising from other flows (in total,
and for each of other changes in volume, exchange
rate changes, and other price changes); and
- Net international investment position.
This list is not comprehensive; other balances can be
derived as needed for analysis. For example, balances
on components in the financial account may be of
interest, such as net direct investment or net portfolio
investments.

CHAPTER
4
Economic Territory, Units,
Institutional Sectors,
and Residence
A. Introduction
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 4, Institutional Units and Sectors.

4.1 This chapter is concerned with identifying statis-
tical units, grouping them (according to the institutional
sector classification), and identifying the economic ter-
ritory to which each entity is most closely connected
(according to the residence principles). The principles
for economic territory, units, institutional sectors, and
residence are harmonized across macroeconomic sta-
tistical guidelines, so this chapter identifies the general
principles as well as specific issues of relevance in an
international accounts context.

4.2 The principles in this chapter define the meaning
and coverage of each national economy. An economy
consists of the institutional units that are resident in the
economic territory of that economy. Most entities have
strong links with only one economy, so their residence
is clear, but with increasing international economic
openness, a growing number of institutional units have
connections to more than one economy.

B. Economic Territory
4.3 In its broadest sense, an economic territory can
be any geographic area or jurisdiction for which statis-
tics are required. The connection of entities to a par-
ticular economic territory is determined from aspects
such as physical presence and being subject to the juris-
diction of the government of the territory. These issues
are discussed in the residence section of this chapter
(see paragraphs 4.113–4.144).

4.4 The most commonly used concept of economic
territory is the area under the effective economic con-
trol of a single government. For the purposes of global
statistics and reporting to the IMF, it is important to

have data on all areas under control of a particular gov-
ernment, including special zones, even if for some of
the government’s own statistical purposes, those zones
are excluded or shown separately. Another kind of eco-
nomic territory is a currency or economic union, which
is dealt with in Appendix 3. Other types of economic
territory include a part of an economy, regions, or the
world as a whole. Economic territories reflect any pos-
sible scope for macroeconomic policy or analysis.
4.5 The economic territory includes:
(a) the land area;
(b) airspace;
(c) territorial waters, including areas over which
jurisdiction is exercised over fishing rights and
rights to fuels or minerals;
(d) in a maritime territory, islands that belong to the
territory; and
(e) territorial enclaves in the rest of the world. These
are clearly demarcated land areas (such as embas-
sies, consulates, military bases, scientific stations,
information or immigration offices, aid agencies,
central bank representative offices with diplo-
matic status) that are physically located in other
territories and used by governments that own or
rent them for diplomatic, military, scientific, or
other purposes with the formal agreement of gov-
ernments of the territories where the land areas
are physically located. These areas may be shared
with other organizations, but the operations must
have a high degree of exemption from local laws
to be treated as an enclave. However, government
operations that are fully subject to the laws of the
host economy are not treated as enclaves, but as
residents of the host economy.
4.6 Economic territory has the dimensions of legal
jurisdiction as well as physical location, so that cor-
porations created under the law are part of that econ-
omy. The concepts of economic territory and residence
are designed to ensure that each institutional unit is a
resident of a single economic territory. The use of an
economic territory as the scope of economic statistics
means that each member of a group of affiliated enter-
prises is part of the economy in which it is resident,
rather than being attributed to the economy of its head
office. The focus on data for an economic territory
means that, in a few cases, a legal entity may be split
for statistical purposes into separate units in different
territories, as elaborated in paragraphs 4.26–4.49.

International organizations

4.7 The economic territory of an international orga-
nization (defined in paragraphs 4.103–4.107) consists
of territorial enclave(s) over which the organization has
jurisdiction. These enclaves are clearly demarcated land
areas or structures that the international organization
owns or rents and uses, and that are formally agreed on
with the government of the territory, or territories, in
which the enclave(s) are physically located. Each inter-
national organization is an economic territory in its own
right, covering operations from all its locations.

Special zones

4.8 Sometimes a government has a separate physical
or legal zone that is under its control, but to which, to
some degree, separate laws are applied. For example,
a free trade zone or offshore financial center may be
exempt from certain taxation or other laws. Because of
the need to view the whole economy, to have compre-
hensive global data, and to be compatible with partner
data, these special zones always should be included in
the economic statistics of that economy. While national
totals showing all economic activities in the economy
are required for international purposes, separate data
may be prepared for different subsets of the economy.
To the extent that different laws and policies may apply,
and persons, goods, and finance do not flow completely
freely between a zone and the rest of the economy, a
government may wish to have data to support sepa-
rate analysis of either or both the special zone and the
remainder of the economy.

Changes in economic territory

4.9 The scope of an economic territory may change
under several circumstances:

(a) The passing of control of a geographic area from
one government to another by mutual agreement
or under a decision of an international court or
arbitrator. These exchanges satisfy the definition
of a transaction. Accordingly, assets conveyed
from one government to the other are recorded
as an acquisition of land (in the capital account)
or equipment and buildings (in goods and ser-
vices,^1 respectively, if they can be separated). If
the exchange is made in exchange for payment or
extinguishing of a prior liability, the correspond-
ing entry is a financial account entry for the
agreed amount. If there is no amount payable,
the corresponding entry is a capital transfer. If
there is a mutual exchange of land or buildings,
both entries in the exchange are shown on a gross
basis (capital account for land, construction in
the goods and services account for buildings). In
addition to these cases involving the two govern-
ments, the exchange of territory could change
the territory of residence of other institutional
units. As with other changes in residence, these
would result in other changes in the volume of
assets. (The effects of changes of residence are
covered in paragraphs 9.21–9.23.)
(b) Change in the status of a particular area by
seizure. Because this change in status is not by
mutual agreement (defined in GFSM 2001 para-
graph 3.5), it is not a transaction. (However, any
institutional units that changed residence could
have other changes in financial assets and liabil-
ities; see paragraphs 9.21–9.23.)
(c) The merger of two or more economic territories
to have a single national government may be seen
as an absorption of one territory by another or
the elimination of two territories and the creation
of another. These arrangements result in entries
in the other changes in volume account (namely,
elimination of cross-border liabilities between
the two previous constituent territories and pos-
sible reclassifications for economies having asset
or liability positions with either territory).
(d) The split of a single economic territory into
two or more territories is not in itself a transac-
tion. However, there may be associated flows
between the parties, for example, compensation
for assuming liabilities that would qualify as
transactions and be classified according to usual
definitions. There also would be entries in the
other changes in volume account for the appear-
(^1) The inclusion of international transactions in new and existing
buildings in services is discussed in paragraph 10.108.
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence

ance of cross-border liabilities between the two
separating economies.
When such events occur, it is essential that metadata
are provided to assist users in understanding how the
territorial changes affect the data.

Joint zones

4.10 In some cases, areas are under joint administra-
tion or sovereignty, that is, an area is under the effective
economic control of two or more governments. These
areas can be called joint administration or sovereignty
zones. Because, typically, they have laws that differ from
the primary territories of the individual governments, the
zone could be considered an economic territory in its
own right. Because the number of enterprises in these
zones typically is small, however, it may be preferred to
split the enterprises in the zone between the primary ter-
ritories rather than publish separate data for the zone. The
method of splitting should be to prorate on the basis of a
relevant factor according to the circumstances, such as
some operational indicator or equal proportions for each
of the primary territories. This general guidance needs to
be applied appropriately to the economic circumstances
faced. For instance, when the enterprises that account for
the vast majority, or all, of the economic activity in the
zone are effectively operated from the economy of just
one of the sovereign authorities, it may be preferred to
treat those enterprises as residents of that economy, show-
ing the other economy as recipient of its share of property
income, taxes, and so on, and avoiding most of the com-
plexities of prorating for those enterprises. The statisti-
cal compilers of each primary territory involved should
consult with each other to adopt consistent methods with
no gaps or overlaps. Through metadata and consultations,
they may also assist compilers in counterpart economies
to ensure consistency of bilateral data.

Definition of an economy

4.11 An economy consists of all the institutional
units that are resident in a particular economic terri-
tory. The concepts of institutional units and residence
are the subject of sections C and E of this chapter,
respectively.

C. Units
4.12 Different types of institutional units are
explained in more detail in this section. Institutional
units and local enterprise groups may be used in inter-
national accounts. Statistical units other than institu-

tional units and enterprises are also described briefly
in this section.
1. General principles on institutional units
Reference:
2008 SNA , Chapter 4, Institutional Units and Sectors.

4.13 The main attributes of an institutional unit
are that:
(a) it is entitled to own goods or assets in its own
right; it is, therefore, able to exchange the owner-
ship of goods or assets in transactions with other
institutional units.
(b) it is able to take economic decisions and engage
in economic activities for which it is itself held to
be directly responsible and accountable at law.
(c) it is able to incur liabilities on its own behalf, to
take on other obligations or future commitments,
and to enter into contracts.
(d) either a complete set of accounts, including a bal-
ance sheet, exists for the unit, or it would be pos-
sible and meaningful, from both an economic
and legal viewpoint, to compile a complete set of
accounts if they were to be required.
Institutional units are recognized in the cases of
branches and notional resident units (as discussed in
paragraphs 4.26–4.44) even though they may not fully
satisfy criteria (a), (b), and (c).
4.14 There are two main types of units in the real
world that may qualify as institutional units:
(a) households—persons or groups of persons; and
(b) corporations (including quasi-corporations), non-
profit institutions, and government units—legal
or social entities whose existence is recognized
by law or society independently of the persons,
or other entities, that may own or control them.
a. Corporations
4.15 Corporations in the legal sense are separate
legal entities, so qualify as institutional units, except as
discussed in paragraph 4.18. In addition to corporations
in the legal sense, some arrangements that are not legal
entities in their own right may be recognized as being
institutional units, including cooperatives, limited lia-
bility partnerships that are not incorporated, notional
resident units, and other quasi-corporations. For exam-
ple, branches in separate economies from their head
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

offices and partnerships are not separate legal entities,
and so they do not satisfy criteria (a), (b), and (c) in
terms of legal capacity, but may be treated as corpora-
tions because they behave in similar ways.

Quasi-corporations
4.16 A quasi-corporation is an unincorporated busi-
ness that operates as if it were an entity separate from
its owner(s). It is treated as if it were a corporation. In
this Manual , the term “corporations” includes quasi-
corporations. Types of quasi-corporations are discussed
in paragraphs 4.26–4.49 and may include branches,
notional residents for ownership of land, trusts, and so
on. The intent behind the concept of a quasi-corpora-
tion is to separate from their owners those unincorpo-
rated enterprises that are sufficiently self-contained,
that is, that behave as if they were corporations.

4.17 For example, a partnership that includes a large
number of partners or partners from different economies
would normally have its accounts and affairs delineated
from its individual owners, and therefore qualify as a
quasi-corporation. A partnership may be limited liabil-
ity or not; however, this does not determine whether
the partnership meets the criteria to be recognized as a
quasi-corporation. As well as private businesses, quasi-
corporations can arise in the public sector when gov-
ernments produce market output, charge economically
significant prices, and have their own accounts. A quasi-
corporation in one economy may be owned by residents
of the same economy, nonresidents, or a combination of
both. Some unincorporated businesses do not satisfy the
requirements to be a quasi-corporation, typically busi-
nesses owned by members of a single household, and
where the business activities are not separated from other
household affairs. (However, the criteria for recognizing
a branch in paragraph 4.27 mean that significant cross-
border businesses will almost always be recognized as
quasi-corporations.)

Resident artificial subsidiaries
4.18 A resident artificial subsidiary is a company set
up to avoid taxes, to minimize liabilities in the event
of bankruptcy, or to secure other technical advantages
under the tax or corporation legislation in force in a par-
ticular economy. As the term is used in the 2008 SNA ,
Chapter 4, Institutional Units and Sectors, an artificial
subsidiary is incorporated or created in the same econ-
omy as its parent and is merged into an institutional unit
with its owner. An entity incorporated in one economy
is never combined with a nonresident owner into a single
institutional unit. Entities in different economies are

not combined because combining across borders would
undermine the concept of the economy as the focus of
macroeconomic statistics. As well, an entity that has two
or more owners who are resident in different economies
cannot be combined with its owners.
4.19 An ancillary corporation is a wholly owned
subsidiary whose productive activities are confined to
providing services to the parent corporation or other
affiliates owned by the same parent corporation. Like
other direct investment enterprises, an ancillary cor-
poration in another economy to that of its owners is a
separate entity from its owners, even though it is not, in
practice, autonomous. Examples of ancillary services
that are sometimes undertaken through subsidiaries
abroad include transport, purchasing, sales and market-
ing, financing, various kinds of business services, com-
puting and communications, security, maintenance,
and cleaning. (For information about recording these
services, see Chapter 10, Part C, Services, and particu-
larly paragraph 10.150.)
b. Splitting and combining legal entities
4.20 Because the focus of economic statistics is on
a single economy, a legal entity may be split into sepa-
rate institutional units for statistical purposes. The step
is taken because each of the parts has such a strong
connection with the economic territory in which it is
located that it should be considered as part of that econ-
omy. In these cases, identifying separate institutional
units resident in each economy allows a more com-
prehensive view of the economies concerned. Cases
include branches, ownership of land, and other arrange-
ments discussed in paragraphs 4.26–4.44. Similarly,
households are defined such that they consist only of
individuals who are resident in the same territory, even
if individuals who are resident in different territories
share expenses and decision making. This definition
avoids a single household having members who are
resident in different economies.
4.21 As noted in paragraph 4.18, legal entities that
are residents of different economies are never combined
in the macroeconomic statistics for a single economy.
However, entities are combined in the case of an artifi-
cial subsidiary if the subsidiary and parent are resident
in the same economy. Accordingly, a corporation is
always resident in its economy of incorporation, in its
own right, or as part of an institutional unit resident in
the same economy.
4.22 Having a set of accounts (or potentially having
them, see paragraph 4.13(d)) provides an important indi-
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence
cation of the status as a separate institutional unit. The
existence of accounts (or the records that could be used
to produce them) provides evidence of the existence of a
unit for which transactions are implemented and can be
measured. It also ensures that data can be obtained for
such units. The definition of an institutional unit has no
requirement that the unit be effectively autonomous, so a
wholly owned subsidiary corporation can be recognized
as a separate institutional unit from its parent, because
corporations satisfy the criteria for an institutional unit
in paragraph 4.13. For statistical purposes, corporations
may be combined if they are residents of the same econ-
omy (under circumstances discussed in paragraph 4.18)
and direct investment data may be collected for a local
enterprise group (discussed in paragraph 4.55).

c. Enterprises

4.23 An enterprise is defined as an institutional unit
engaged in production. Investment funds and other cor-
porations or trusts that hold assets and liabilities on behalf
of groups of owners are also enterprises, even if they are
engaged in little or no production. (As discussed in para-
graphs 10.124–10.125, institutional units that hold assets
on behalf of their owners are providers of financial ser-
vices to their owners.) An enterprise may be a corporation
(including a quasi-corporation), a nonprofit institution, or
an unincorporated enterprise. Corporate enterprises and
nonprofit institutions are complete institutional units. An
unincorporated enterprise, however, refers to a part of an
institutional unit—a household or government unit—only
in its capacity as a producer of goods and services.

d. Implementation

4.24 There may be some variation from institutional
unit definitions in practice because of data sources; for
example, arising from consolidation or use of admin-
istrative approximations. These variations should be
monitored by statistical compilers to identify possible
problems (e.g., cross-border or cross-sector consolida-
tion). It is important that both data suppliers and com-
pilers have a clear understanding of the scope of the
unit being reported—a single legal entity, a selected
group of legal entities, or all the legal entities under
common ownership. Otherwise, some values could be
omitted, double-counted, or misclassified.

2. Identification of institutional units with
cross-border elements

4.25 Artificial institutional units are sometimes iden-
tified by breaking up an actual entity. However, to avoid

excessive creation of artificial units, such cases are lim-
ited to the few circumstances discussed in this section.
a. Branches
4.26 When a nonresident unit has substantial opera-
tions over a significant period in an economic terri-
tory, but no separate legal entity for those operations, a
branch may be identified as an institutional unit. This
unit is identified for statistical purposes because the
operations have a strong connection to the location of
operations in all ways other than incorporation.
4.27 The identification of branches as separate insti-
tutional units requires indications of substantial opera-
tions that can be separated from the rest of the entity,
to avoid creating numerous artificial units. A branch is
recognized in the following cases:
(a) Either a complete set of accounts, including a
balance sheet, exists for the branch, or it is pos-
sible and meaningful, from both an economic
and legal viewpoint, to compile these accounts if
they were to be required. The availability of sep-
arate records indicates that an actual unit exists
and makes it practical to prepare statistics.
In addition, one or both of the following factors tend to
be present for a branch:
(b) The branch undertakes or intends to undertake
production on a significant scale that is based in
a territory other than that of its head office for
one year or more:
(i) if the production process involves physi-
cal presence, then the operations should be
physically located in that territory. Some
indicators of an intention to locate in the ter-
ritory include purchasing or renting business
premises, acquiring capital equipment, and
recruiting local staff; or
(ii) if the production does not involve physical
presence, such as some cases of banking,
insurance, other financial services, owner-
ship of patents, and “virtual manufacturing,”
the operations should be recognized as being
in the territory by virtue of the registration
or legal domicile of those operations in that
territory; or
(c) The branch is recognized as being subject to
the income tax system, if any, of the economy
in which it is located even if it may have a tax-
exempt status. (Usually, treatments by taxa-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

tion authorities are a guide to the existence of
branches, because the authorities are reluctant
to exempt substantial operations within their
jurisdiction.)
4.28 The identification of branches has implica-
tions for the statistical reporting of both the parent
and branch.^2 The operations of the branch should be
excluded from the institutional unit of its head office
in its home territory and the delineation of parent and
branch should be made consistently in both of the
affected economies. Each branch is a direct invest-
ment enterprise. Branches most commonly arise for
financial and nonfinancial corporations, but it is also
possible that households, nonprofit institutions serving
households (NPISHs), or governments (when govern-
ment operations do not have diplomatic immunity) may
have branches.

Construction projects
4.29 Some construction projects undertaken by a
nonresident contractor may give rise to a branch (direct
investment enterprise). Construction may be carried
out or managed by a nonresident enterprise, without the
creation of a local legal entity:

(a) For major projects (such as bridges, dams, power
stations) that take a year or more to complete and
that are managed through a local site office, the
operations would usually satisfy the criteria for
identification of a branch in paragraph 4.27 and
so would not be classified as trade in services;
(b) In other cases, the construction operations may
not satisfy the conditions for recognition as a
branch, for example, for a short-term project or
one based from the home territory rather than a
local office. In those cases, the work provided
to customers resident in the territory of those
operations is classified as international trade
in construction and included in services (i.e.,
an export of services by the home base and an
import of services by the territory of operations).
Pa ragraphs 10.101–10.108 discuss constr uction
operations included under services.
Production delivered from a base
4.30 Activities such as consulting, maintenance,
training, technical assistance, and health care may be

(^2) The international accounts use of branch as a term is more limited
than common usage, where “branch” may also mean establishments,
incorporated subsidiaries, or industrial classification groups.
provided by a branch or from a home base. If opera-
tions are substantial enough to satisfy the criteria given
in paragraph 4.27, a branch would be recognized as
a direct investment enterprise. On the other hand, if
a branch is not recognized in the territory, the opera-
tions will give rise to international trade in services.
The residence of units providing services in this way is
discussed in paragraph 4.136.
4.31 Mobile equipment, such as ships, aircraft,
drilling platforms, and railway rolling stock, may
operate across more than one economic territory. The
criteria for recognition of a branch also apply in these
cases. That is, if the operations in a territory outside
the home base are substantial enough, they meet the
definition of a branch. For example, a secondary base
for servicing the fleet with long-term presence and its
own accounts may satisfy the definition of a branch.
(If they do not satisfy the definition of a branch, the
activities of the ship-operating enterprise are included
in the economy where the operator is resident; see
paragraph 4.136.)
4.32 Similarly to mobile equipment, a multiter-
ritory pipeline that passes through a territory, but is
not operated by a separate legal entity in that terri-
tory, would be recognized as constituting a branch if
there is a substantial presence, availability of sepa-
rate accounts, and so on. In cases in which such
operations are not separate institutional units (a)
there may be payment of rent to a notional unit own-
ing the land or a long-term lease of land, of the kind
discussed in paragraphs 4.34–4.40; or (b) there may
be a multiterritory enterprise of the type discussed in
paragraphs 4.41–4.44.
4.33 When a branch is identified, there are direct
investment inflows to the territory, but the provision of
goods or services to customers in that territory is a resi-
dent-to-resident transaction. In contrast, if the opera-
tions are not substantial enough to qualify as a branch,
the provision of goods or services to customers in that
territory are imports of that territory.
b. Notional resident units for land and other
natural resources owned by nonresidents
4.34 When land located in a territory is owned by a
nonresident entity, a notional resident unit is identified
for statistical purposes as being the owner of the land.
Because land and buildings produce rental services
(see paragraph 10.157), the notional unit is usually an
enterprise. A notional unit is also identified for a lease
of land, or buildings, or land and buildings together
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence

by a nonresident for long periods. This notional resi-
dent unit is a kind of quasi-corporation. The notional
resident unit is also treated as the owner of any build-
ings, structures, and other improvements on that land
that belong to the same nonresident owner. The non-
resident is treated as owning the notional resident unit,
rather than owning the land or structures directly.
This treatment is designed so that land and other natu-
ral resources are always assets of the economy in
whose territory they are located. Otherwise, the land
would appear in another economy’s national balance
sheet. The situation in which the land is acquired or
sold for an embassy or other enclave is discussed in
paragraph 13.10.

4.35 A nonresident with a resource lease is classi-
fied as incurring rent and no notional unit is automati-
cally created. (Rent and resource leases are defined in
paragraph 11.85.) However, it is usually the case that
ownership of land and other natural resources such
as subsoil assets, noncultivated biological resources,
water, and rights to use these assets through a lease or
other permit over long periods are associated with a
branch (see paragraph 4.27). In addition, preliminary
expenses for an entity to be incorporated in the future
are to be regarded as a notional direct investment enter-
prise (see paragraph 4.47).

4.36 The operations of notional resident units include
holding the asset, paying any associated expenses (such
as insurance, repairs, and taxes), collecting rent or
rental on the asset,^3 and any other transactions associ-
ated with those functions. If the nonresident owner uses
the property, the notional resident unit generates rent
(in the case of unimproved land, mineral rights, and
so on, see paragraph 11.85) or rental included in travel
or operating leasing services (for land with buildings
or other improvements, see paragraphs 10.99, 10.100,
and 10.157) in kind to its owner. The corresponding
entry to the rent or rental would be income payable in
kind to the owner by the notional resident unit. The
notional resident unit should also be treated as incur-
ring expenses and taxes; payments by the nonresident
owner to meet a loss arising from these costs therefore
would be recorded as direct investment flows from the
owner to the notional resident unit. Other transactions
of the owner would not be attributed to the notional res-
ident unit, for example, any borrowing or debt service.
As a result of the limited nature of notional resident

(^3) The distinction between rent and rental is explained in para-
graphs 10.153 and 11.84–11.86.
units, making acceptable estimates for their operations
is generally feasible when they are significant.
4.37 When the ownership of land and other natu-
ral resources is associated with substantial operations,
so that the requirements in paragraph 4.27 are met, a
branch is identified. In such cases, a notional resident
unit is not identified because the branch already exists
as a resident owner.
4.38 The notional resident unit that owns land
or other natural resources may be contrasted with a
branch, which has a full set of accounts. An example is
a nonresident fishing operator having a 10-year fishing
license for the waters of a territory. If the operator has a
base in the territory, keeps separate records, and so on,
then a branch is identified, and its accounts will show
sales of fish and other transactions. Another example
could be a commercial farm owned by a nonresident
entity. In contrast, the only activity of a notional unit
will be the supply of rent or rental services arising from
the ownership of property.
4.39 When several partners own land, there may be
a quasi-corporation, as in paragraph 4.49, by virtue of
the management of the land being separate from that
of its individual owners. In that case, for statistical
purposes, the nonresident partners would own a share
in the quasi-corporation, so there would be no need
to identify an additional notional resident unit. The
notional resident unit for ownership of land is almost
always a direct investment enterprise (the exception
being for land where an individual nonresident’s voting
power was below 10 percent).
4.40 Some kinds of time-share accommodation
arrangements give rise to a notional resident unit (see
paragraph 10.100 and Table 10.3 for a discussion of
alternative arrangements).
c. Multiterritory enterprises
4.41 Some enterprises may operate as a seam-
less operation over more than one economic territory.
Although the enterprise has substantial activity in more
than one economic territory, it is run as an indivis-
ible operation with no separate accounts or decisions,
so that no separate branches can be identified. Such
enterprises may have operations including shipping
lines, airlines, hydroelectric schemes on border rivers,
pipelines, bridges, tunnels, and undersea cables. Some
NPISHs also may operate in this way.
4.42 Governments usually require separate entities
or branches to be identified in each economic territory
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

for more convenient regulation and taxation. Multiter-
ritory enterprises may be exempted from such require-
ments, but there may be arrangements, such as a formula
for payment of taxation to the respective authorities.

4.43 In the case of a multiterritory enterprise, it
is preferable that separate institutional units be iden-
tified for each economy, as discussed in paragraphs
4.26–4.33. If that is not feasible because the operation
is so seamless that separate accounts cannot be devel-
oped, it is necessary to prorate the total operations of
the enterprise into the individual economic territories.
The factor used for prorating should be based on avail-
able information that reflects the contributions to actual
operations. For example, equity shares, equal splits, or
splits based on operational factors such as tonnages or
wages could be considered. Where taxation authori-
ties have accepted the multiterritory arrangements, a
prorating formula may have been determined, which
should be the starting point for statistical purposes.
Although the situation is somewhat different from the
case of joint administration or sovereignty zones, dis-
cussed under economic territory in paragraph 4.10, the
solution of prorating may be the same.

4.44 The proration of the enterprise means that
all transactions need to be split into each component
economic territory. The treatment is quite complex to
implement. This treatment has implications for other
statistics and its implementation should always be coor-
dinated for consistency. Compilers in each of the terri-
tories involved are encouraged to cooperate to develop
consistent data, avoid gaps, and minimize respondent
and compilation burden, as well as assist counterparties
to report bilateral data on a consistent basis.

d. Joint ventures

4.45 A joint venture is a contractual agreement between
two or more parties for the purpose of executing a busi-
ness undertaking in which the parties agree to share in the
profits and losses of the enterprise as well as the capital
formation and contribution of operating inputs or costs.
It is similar to a partnership, but typically differs in that
there is generally no intention of a continuing relationship
beyond the original purpose. A joint venture does not
involve the creation of a new legal entity.

4.46 Whether a quasi-corporation is identified for
the joint venture depends on the arrangements of the
parties and legal requirements. The joint venture is
a quasi-corporation if it meets the requirements for
an institutional unit, particularly by having its own
records. Otherwise, if each of the operations are effec-

tively undertaken by the partners individually, then the
joint venture is not the institutional unit and the opera-
tions would be seen as being undertaken by the joint
venture partners separately. (In that case, there would
usually be direct investment enterprises that undertook
the joint venture operations of each of the partners.)
Because of the ambiguous status of joint ventures, there
is a risk that they could be omitted or double-counted,
so particular attention needs to be paid to them.
e. Quasi-corporations identified prior to
incorporation
4.47 A resident enterprise is identified when prelim-
inary expenses, including mining rights, license fees,
site preparation, building permits, purchase taxes, local
office expenses, and lawyers’ fees, are incurred prior
to establishing a legal entity. As a result of identify-
ing a quasi-corporation, those preparatory expenses are
recorded in the economy of the future operations as
being resident-to-resident transactions that are funded
by a direct investment inflow, rather than as sale of
nonproduced assets to nonresidents, exports of legal
services, and so on. Because of the limited scale of
these activities, assembly of acceptable data for these
enterprises is often feasible, despite the lack of incor-
poration. If the project does not subsequently go into
operation, the value of the direct investment is elimi-
nated by an entry for other changes in the volume of
assets or liabilities.
f. Trusts
4.48 Trusts are legal arrangements that have
aspects of legal identity separate from their ben-
eficiaries and trustees. Similarly, the estate of a
deceased person is held by an administrator (execu-
tor or trustee) on behalf of the beneficiaries and
is separate from the executor’s other property. A
trust is a legal device by which property is held in
the name of one party or parties (the administrator
or trustee) who is under a fiduciary obligation to
hold assets for the benefit of another party or parties
(the beneficiary or beneficiaries). (In some cases, a
person can be both trustee and beneficiary.) Founda-
tions and other fiduciary arrangements may have
similar functions. Administrators and trustees are
required to keep the trust and estate assets separate
from their personal property and they must account
to the beneficiaries for the income and assets. These
legal arrangements are treated as separate institu-
tional units—that is, as quasi-corporations—if they
are constituted in a different territory to that of any
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence
of the beneficiaries or otherwise satisfy the defini-
tion of a quasi-corporation. This treatment is neces-
sary because it is neither meaningful nor feasible for
the trust assets to be allocated to the beneficiaries
and then be combined with the assets of beneficia-
ries who are resident in another economy.^4 Trusts
can be used for businesses, asset management, and
nonprofit institutions. (Related issues are nominee
accounts, covered in paragraph 4.160, and depository
receipts, covered in paragraph 4.161.)

g. Other unincorporated enterprises

4.49 As stated in paragraph 4.16, a quasi-corporation
is an unincorporated business that operates as if it were
an entity separate from its owners. There is almost always
a quasi-corporation if the operations are in a separate
economy from at least one of their owners, because taxa-
tion, other laws, and convenience are all factors that tend
to prevent the affairs of residents of different economies
from being mixed. This treatment is applied whether a
branch, trust, limited liability or other type of partnership,
or other legal structure is used.

h. Flexible corporate structures with little or no
physical presence

4.50 Special purpose entities (SPEs) or vehicles,
international business companies, shell companies,
shelf companies, and brass plate companies are all
labels that are applied to flexible legal structures in
particular jurisdictions, which offer various benefits
that may include any or all of low or concessional tax
rates, speedy and low-cost incorporation, limited regu-
latory burdens, and confidentiality. Although there is
no internationally standard definition of such compa-
nies, typical features of these entities are that their
owners are not residents of the territory of incorpora-
tion, other parts of their balance sheets are claims on or
liabilities to nonresidents, they have few or no employ-
ees, and they have little or no physical presence.

4.51 Some purposes that such structures are used
for include (a) holding and managing wealth for indi-
viduals or families, (b) holding assets for securitization,
(c) issuing debt securities on behalf of related com-
panies (such a company may be called a conduit), (d)
as holding companies that own shares in subsidiaries
but without actively directing them, (e) as securitiza-
tion vehicles, (f) as ancillary companies in different

trust) or even unborn.
economies to that of their parent, and (g) carrying out
other financial functions. The “captive financial insti-
tutions and money lenders” institutional sector class
is applicable to many of these entities, as discussed in
paragraphs 4.82–4.87. Although these entities do not
have a standard international definition, the possibil-
ity of recording them separately according to national
definitions is discussed in paragraph 4.87.
4.52 These entities are always treated as separate
institutional units if they are resident in a different ter-
ritory to that of their owners.

3. Statistical units other than institutional
units and enterprises

Reference:
2008 SNA , Chapter 5, Enterprises, Establishments and
Industries.
Establishments
4.53 An establishment is an enterprise, or part of an
enterprise, that is situated in a single location and in
which only a single productive activity is carried out or
in which the principal productive activity accounts for
most of the value added. The breaking up of enterprises
into one or more establishments is useful because some
enterprises are large and complex, with different kinds
of economic activity undertaken in different locations.
The establishment is particularly useful as a unit for
production statistics. Because the establishments of
a multiestablishment enterprise are part of the same
legal entity, financial transactions and positions cannot
always be attributed to a particular location or activity,
so the use of the institutional unit concept is appropriate
for statistics covering financial transactions and posi-
tions, such as the balance of payments and IIP.
Local and global enterprise groups
4.54 Groups of enterprises are sometimes iden-
tified in defining and classifying direct investment.
Although enterprises are the basic unit of economic
statistics, a single owner or group of owners may have
control of more than one enterprise, so they may act
in a concerted way and the transactions between the
enterprises may not be driven by the same concerns as
“arm’s-length” transactions, that is, those with unre-
lated enterprises.
4.55 Enterprise groups may be either global or local.
A global enterprise group refers to an investor and all
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

the enterprises under that investor, whereas the local
(or territory-specific) enterprise group refers to an
investor and the legal entities under that investor
that are resident in the reporting economy. Business
accounting may cover groups of related corporate
entities (consolidated accounts) including entities
that are resident in different economies. However,
entities in different economies are not aggregated
for macroeconomic statistics that have a focus on an
economy. The concepts of global enterprise groups
and local enterprise groups are used in the OECD
Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment.
The global enterprise group is also called a multina-
tional enterprise.

4.56 Local enterprise groups may be used for com-
piling and presenting direct investment statistics. For
example, if direct investment is initially channeled
to a holding company and then on to a manufactur-
ing subsidiary, then it may shed light to classify the
direct investment in manufacturing rather than in a
holding company operation, which is just the initial
investment. The implications of combining entities
in different institutional sectors need to be carefully
considered.

D. Institutional Sectors
References:

2008 SNA , Chapter 4, Institutional Units and Sectors.
IMF, MFSM 2000 , Chapter 3, Institutional Units and
Sectors.
IMF, GFSM 2001 , paragraphs 2.28–2.62 (for general
government and public sectors).

1. General principles

4.57 Institutional units are grouped into institu-
tional sectors. The units in each sector have similar
economic objectives, functions, and behavior. The
institutional sector classification is mainly applied to
resident units, but it also could be applied to compiling
supplementary data on the sector of the nonresident
counterpart. For example, in an economy that received
international aid, there may be interest in separating
data on aid provided by other governments from aid
provided by private sources.

4.58 When an ancillary corporation is a separate
institutional unit, according to the criteria in paragraph
4.19, it is classified as financial or nonfinancial accord-
ing to the activities it undertakes, rather than according

to the predominant sector of the company or companies
it serves.
4.59 The SNA institutional sector classification is
shown in Table 4.1. The international accounts insti-
tutional sector classification is shown in Table 4.2.
It has the same sectors and subsectors as the SNA
institutional sector classification shown in Table 4.1,
but with order and groupings to allow greater back-
ward compatibility with the BPM5 classification and
a shorter list of sectors for economies in which it is
not practical to implement the full classification. The
other sectors category includes both financial and
nonfinancial sectors, so it is recommended that, at
least, the financial corporations be identified sepa-
rately. The full institutional sector detail is required
for international accounts to be fully integrated with
monetary, flow of funds, and other financial data.
Public corporations may be identified separately on
a supplementary basis, as discussed in paragraphs
4.108–4.112.
4.60 Transactions in financial instruments recorded
in the balance of payments raise particular issues con-
cerning attribution of institutional sector. The eco-
nomic owner of the asset, the creditor, is invariably
one party to any change of economic ownership of the
asset. Therefore, for assets, sector attribution by credi-
tor and by transactor coincide. A claim on a resident
debtor, however, may change ownership between a
resident creditor and a nonresident creditor so that the
domestic sector of the debtor may not coincide with
that of the transactor. For instance, the issuer may
be a resident in one institutional sector, the seller a
resident in another institutional sector, and the buyer
a nonresident.
4.61 Although the sector classification for IIP lia-
bilities is clearly according to the issuer, for the sector
data in the financial account, there are both practical
and analytical considerations over whether the sec-
tor allocation should be determined according to the
issuer or the seller. By convention, the sector of the
debtor is the one that determines the classification of
the change of ownership that has occurred, because the
original nature of the liability is generally considered
more significant than the identity of the resident seller
of the claim. These issues are discussed in the context
of partner economy data in paragraphs 4.152–4.154
and 14.24.^5 The same issues apply for financial instru-
(^5) An additional factor for institutional sector data is that, in the
national accounts, data for the sector of the seller will show a dis-
posal of an asset.

ments issued by a resident that are sold by a nonresident
holder to a resident buyer.

2. Definitions of institutional sectors and
subsectors

a. Nonfinancial corporations

4.62 Nonfinancial corporations are corporations
whose principal activity is the production of mar-
ket goods or nonfinancial services. These include
legally constituted corporations, branches of non-
resident enterprises, quasi-corporations, notional
resident units owning land, and resident nonprofit
institutions that are market producers of goods or
nonfinancial services.

b. Financial corporations
Reference:
IMF, Monetary and Financial Statistics Compilation
Guide , Chapter 3, Institutional Units and Sectors.
4.63 Financial corporations consist of all corpo-
rations and quasi-corporations that are principally
engaged in providing financial services, including
insurance and pension fund services, to other institu-
tional units. The production of financial services is the
result of financial intermediation, financial risk man-
agement, liquidity transformation, or auxiliary finan-
cial services. In other manuals, financial corporations
are sometimes called financial institutions.

4.64 Financial corporations can be divided into
three broad classes, namely, financial intermediaries,
financial auxiliaries, and other financial corporations:

(a) Financial intermediaries consist of deposit-
taking corporations, investment funds, other
financial intermediaries, insurance corporations,
and pension funds. Financial intermediation is a
productive activity in which an institutional unit
incurs liabilities on its own account for the pur-
pose of acquiring financial assets by engaging in
financial transactions on the market. Financial
intermediaries as institutional units collect funds
from lenders and transform or repackage them
(with respect to maturity, scale, risk, and the like)
in ways that suit the requirements of borrowers.
Through financial intermediation, funds are chan-
neled between parties with a surplus on one side
and those with a need for funds on the other. A
financial intermediary does not simply act as an
agent for these other institutional units but places
itself at risk by acquiring financial assets and
incurring liabilities on its own account.
(b) Financial auxiliaries are institutional units prin-
cipally engaged in serving financial markets, but
they do not take ownership of the financial assets
and liabilities they handle or regulate.
(c) Other financial corporations are institutional
units providing financial services, where most
of their assets or liabilities are not available on
open financial markets. These corporations are
included in the captive financial institutions and
money lenders subsector.
4.65 The SNA further identifies nine subsectors of
the financial corporations subsector (shown in Table
4.1 and as discussed in the following paragraphs).
They are used in the following ways in international
accounts:
(a) The standard components use three subsectors:
the central bank, deposit-taking corporations
except the central bank, and the other seven
subsectors combined as “other financial cor-
porations.” Additional details can be compiled
according to circumstances.
(b) The functional category classification of debt
positions between affiliated financial intermedi-
aries is defined in terms of the first five subsec-
tors of the financial sector—that is, the central
bank, deposit-taking corporations except the cen-
tral bank, money market funds (MMFs), other
investment funds, and other financial intermedi-
aries (except insurance corporations and pension

funds, ICPFs). Such debt is excluded from direct
investment, as discussed in paragraph 6.28.
4.66 Although the financial corporations sector
and its subsectors are defined in terms of economic
function, data sources may tend to follow regulatory
definitions. Differences between regulatory and statis-
tical definitions should be monitored, and adjustments
made, where necessary.

Central bank
4.67 The central bank is the financial institution
(or institutions) that exercises control over key aspects
of the financial system. It carries out such activities
as issuing currency, managing international reserves,
transacting with the IMF, and providing credit to
deposit-taking corporations. The central bank of a cur-
rency union is classified as a central bank in the data for
the currency union as a whole; in the data of individual
member states, it is part of the rest of the world sector.
Central banks in some economies also accept deposits
from or provide credit to entities in other sectors.

4.68 The central bank subsector includes the
following:

(a) central banks, which in most economies are sep-
arately identifiable institutions that are subject to
varying degrees of government control, engage
in differing sets of activities, and are designated
by various names (e.g., central bank, reserve
bank, national bank, or state bank);
(b) currency boards or independent currency author-
ities that issue national currency that is fully
backed by foreign exchange reserves; and
(c) government-affiliated agencies that are separate
institutional units and primarily perform central
bank activities.
If an institutional unit is mainly engaged in central
banking activities, the entire unit is classified in the
central bank subsector. Many central banks regulate or
supervise other deposit-taking corporations and other
financial corporations, and these central bank activi-
ties also are included in the central bank subsector.
However, units that are affiliated with the government
or with other sectors and are mainly engaged in regu-
lating or supervising financial units are classified as
financial auxiliaries rather than as units in the central
bank subsector. Private units that perform activities
such as check-clearing operations are assigned to other
financial corporations subsectors depending on their
activities, rather than to the central bank.

4.69 A few economies do not have central banks.
Typical central banking activities that are performed
by general government and cannot be separated into
specific institutional units are treated as part of general
government and are not allocated to the central bank
subsector.
4.70 In economies in which some central banking
functions are performed wholly or partly outside the
central bank, particularly holding reserve assets, con-
sideration should be given to compiling supplementary
data for the monetary authorities sector, as defined in
paragraph 6.66. The concept of monetary authorities
underlies reserves assets.
Deposit-taking corporations, except the
central bank
4.71 Deposit-taking corporations, except the central
bank have financial intermediation as their principal
activity. To this end, they have liabilities in the form of
deposits or financial instruments (such as short-term
certificates of deposit) that are close substitutes for
deposits. In general, the following financial intermedi-
aries are classified in this subsector:
(a) commercial banks, “universal” banks, and “all-
purpose” banks;
(b) savings banks (including trustee savings banks
and savings and loan associations);
(c) post office giro institutions, post banks, and giro
banks;
(d) rural credit banks and agricultural credit banks;
(e) cooperative credit banks and credit unions;
(f) traveler’s check companies that mainly engage in
financial activities; and
(g) specialized banks or other financial institutions
if they take deposits or issue close substitutes for
deposits.
4.72 The liabilities of deposit-taking corporations to
residents are typically included in measures of broad
money. The money-issuing sector may be identified
on a supplementary basis to assist in reconciliation
with monetary data. It consists of the central bank
plus deposit-taking corporations plus other institu-
tions included in the definition of broad money (e.g.,
MMFs in some cases). Deposit-taking corporations
that engage exclusively (or almost exclusively) with
nonresidents, often called offshore banks or offshore
banking units, are included in deposit-taking corpo-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

rations, but they may be excluded from the money-
issuing sector because their liabilities are not included
in broad money. MMFs are separate from deposit-
taking corporations and should be identified separately
in the circumstances discussed in paragraph 4.73.

Money market funds
4.73 MMFs are collective investment schemes that
raise funds by issuing shares or units to the public.
The proceeds are invested primarily in money market
instruments, MMF shares and units, transferable debt
instruments with a residual maturity of less than one
year, bank deposits, and instruments that pursue a rate
of return that approaches the interest rates of money
market instruments. MMF shares can be transferred
by check or other means of direct third-party payment.
Because of the nature of the instruments that MMFs
invest in, their shares or units may be regarded as close
substitutes for deposits. When MMFs are included
in monetary aggregates, showing MMFs as an extra
subsector will assist comparability. (The correspond-
ing specialized financial instrument—MMF shares or
units—is discussed in paragraph 5.29.)

Non-MMF investment funds
4.74 Non-MMF investment funds are collective
investment schemes that raise funds by issuing shares
or units to the public. The proceeds are invested pre-
dominantly in long-term financial assets and nonfinan-
cial assets (usually real estate). Investment fund shares
or units are generally not close substitutes for deposits.
They are not transferable by means of check or third-
party payments. Some funds may be limited to certain
investors only, whereas others are available to the public
generally. Investment funds can be open or closed ended.
Open-ended funds or open funds are those whose shares
or units are, at the request of the holders, repurchased or
redeemed directly or indirectly out of the undertaking’s
assets. Closed-ended, closed, or exchange-traded funds
are those with a fixed share capital, where investors
entering or leaving the fund must buy or sell existing
shares. Investment funds may be constituted as follows:
(a) under the law of contract (as common funds managed
by management companies), (b) under trust law (as unit
trusts), (c) under a statute (as investment companies), or
(d) otherwise with similar effect. Some investment funds
invest in other funds (“funds of funds”). Pension funds
are excluded; they are part of the insurance companies
and pension funds subsector. Real estate investment
trusts are included. Investment fund shares are shown
as a financial instrument (as defined in paragraph 5.28).

Fund managers of investment funds are financial auxil-
iaries (paragraph 4.80(h)).
4.75 Hedge funds are a kind of investment fund.
Hedge fund is a term that covers a heterogeneous range
of collective investment schemes, typically involving
high minimum investments, light regulation, and a
wide range of investment strategies. However, special
purpose government funds, usually called sovereign
wealth funds, are more likely to be classified as captive
financial institutions than as investment funds, given
the nature of their liabilities, if classified as a financial
corporation (see the footnote to paragraph 4.92).
Other financial intermediaries, except insurance
corporations and pension funds
4.76 Other financial intermediaries, except ICPFs,
consist of financial corporations and quasi-corporations
that are engaged in providing financial services by incur-
ring liabilities, in forms other than currency, deposits, or
close substitutes for deposits, on their own account for
the purpose of acquiring financial assets by engaging in
financial transactions on the market, and that are not
included in another subsector. It is a feature of a financial
intermediary that operations for both sides of the balance
sheet are carried out in open markets.
4.77 In general, the following financial intermediar-
ies are classified in this subsector:
(a) financial corporations engaged in the securitiza-
tion of assets;
(b) underwriters, and securities and derivative deal-
ers (on own account). In contrast, security bro-
kers and other units that arrange trades between
buyers and sellers but do not purchase and hold
securities on their own account are classified as
financial auxiliaries (see paragraph 4.80(b));
(c) financial corporations engaged in lending, includ-
ing financial leasing, as well as personal or com-
mercial finance;
(d) central clearing counterparties, which provide
clearing and settlement of market transactions in
securities and derivatives. Clearing refers to the
process of offsetting obligations and entitlements
vis-à-vis counterparties to transactions so that
settlement—which involves the actual exchange
of securities, derivatives, and funds—can occur
more efficiently on a net basis. The central clear-
ing counterparties involve themselves in the
transaction and mitigate counterparty risk;
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence
(e) specialized financial corporations that assist
other corporations in raising funds in equity and
debt markets and provide strategic advisory ser-
vices for mergers, acquisitions, and other types
of financial transactions. (These corporations are
sometimes called “investment banks.”) In addi-
tion to assisting with the raising of funds for their
corporate clients, such corporations invest their
own funds, including in private equity, in hedge
funds dedicated to venture capital, and in collater-
alized lending. However, if such corporations take
deposits or close substitutes for deposits, they are
classified as deposit-taking corporations; and
(f) any other specialized financial corporations that
provide short-term financing for corporate merg-
ers and takeovers; export and import finance;
factoring companies; and venture capital and
development capital firms.
4.78 Securitization involves raising funds by selling
a security backed by specific assets or income streams.
For example, an originating mortgage lender could sell
a portfolio of loans to a special purpose vehicle that
issues units sold to investors. The originator may con-
tinue to provide administrative services, but the vehi-
cle is the legal owner of the portfolio. Such vehicles
are included in “other financial intermediaries, except
ICPFs” if the entity is the legal owner of a portfolio
of assets, sells a new financial asset that represents an
interest in the portfolio, and has or potentially has a full
set of accounts. However, in cases in which the origina-
tor issues asset-backed securities on its own books, then
securitization may take place without the creation of a
separate entity. When the portfolio is not transformed,
or the vehicle does not bear market or credit risks, then
it can be combined with its parent (if resident in the
same economy) or treated as a captive intermediary
(if in a different economy to that of its parent). Asset-
backed securities are discussed as financial instruments
in paragraph 5.47.

Financial auxiliaries
4.79 Financial auxiliaries consist of all financial
corporations that are principally engaged in activities
associated with transactions in financial assets and
liabilities or with providing the regulatory context for
these transactions but in circumstances that do not
involve the auxiliary taking ownership of the financial
assets and liabilities being transacted.

4.80 In general, the following financial corporations
are classified in the financial auxiliaries subsector:

(a) insurance brokers, salvage administrators, and
insurance and pension consultants;
(b) loan brokers, securities brokers that arrange trades
between security buyers and sellers but that do not
purchase and hold securities on their own account,
investment advisers, and so on (securities dealers
that trade in securities on their own account are
other financial intermediaries);
(c) flotation corporations that manage the issue of
securities;
(d) corporations whose principal function is to
guarantee, by endorsement, bills and similar
instruments;
(e) corporations that arrange derivative and hedging
instruments, such as swaps, options, and futures
(without issuing them);
(f) stock exchanges, insurance exchanges, and com-
modity and derivative exchanges;
(g) other corporations providing infrastructure for
financial markets, such as securities depository
companies, custodians, clearing offices,^6 and
nominee companies;
(h) fund managers of pension funds, mutual funds,
and so on (but not the funds they manage);
(i) nonprofit institutions recognized as independent
legal entities serving financial corporations, but
that are not themselves providing financial ser-
vices, for example, bankers’ associations;
(j) holding companies that exercise some aspects of
managerial control over their subsidiaries (see
paragraph 4.85);
(k) foreign exchange bureaus and money transfer
operators;
(l) resident offices of foreign banks that do not
accept deposits or extend credit on their own
account;
(m) corporations primarily involved in operation
of electronic payment mechanisms that do not
incur liabilities against the instruments (if they
do incur liabilities against the instruments, then
they are other financial intermediaries except
ICPFs); and
(^6) Clearing offices are classified as financial auxiliaries when
they facilitate transactions without acting as the counterparty; in
contrast, central clearing counterparties, as discussed in paragraph
4.77(d) are counterparties and thus are classified as intermediaries
rather than auxiliaries.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

(n) central supervisory authorities of financial inter-
mediaries and financial markets when they are
separate institutional units.
4.81 Corporations facilitating financial transactions,
such as central clearing counterparties, stock exchanges,
derivative exchanges, and repurchase agreement settlement
institutions are financial intermediaries, if they generally
act as principals to the counterparties to the underlying
transactions; otherwise they are financial auxiliaries.

Captive financial institutions and money lenders
4.82 Captive financial institutions and money lend-
ers consist of institutional units providing financial
services other than insurance, where most of either
their assets or liabilities are not transacted on open
financial markets. It includes entities transacting only
within a limited group of units, such as with subsidiar-
ies or subsidiaries of the same holding corporation, or
entities that provide loans from own funds provided
by only one sponsor. Other financial intermediaries,
except ICPFs (discussed in paragraphs 4.76–4.77) are
distinguished from captive financial institutions and
money lenders in that the latter serve a limited group
only for at least one side of their balance sheet.

4.83 In general, the following financial corporations
are classified in this subsector:

(a) institutional units with the function of simply
holding assets, such as trusts, estates, agencies
accounts, and some “brassplate” companies;
(b) institutional units that provide financial services
exclusively with own funds, or funds provided
by a sponsor to a range of clients and incur the
financial risk of the debtor defaulting. Examples
are moneylenders and corporations engaged in
lending (e.g., student loans, import and export
loans) from funds received from a sponsor such
as a government unit or nonprofit institution;
(c) pawnshops that predominantly engage in
lending;
(d) financial corporations, such as SPEs, that raise
funds in open markets to be used by affiliated
corporations (in contrast to securitization vehi-
cles, see paragraph 4.78); and
(e) conduits, intragroup financiers, and treasury
functions when these functions are undertaken
by a separate institutional unit.
Captive insurance companies and pension funds are not
included in this subsector.

Holding companies
4.84 Holding companies are included in this subsec-
tor, financial auxiliaries, or nonfinancial corporations,
according to which functions they undertake. One type
of holding company is a unit that holds equity in one or
more subsidiaries but does not undertake any manage-
ment activities. These companies are described in the
International Standard Industrial Classification of All
Economic Activities ( ISIC ), Rev. 4, in section K class
6420 as follows:
This class includes the activities of holding
companies, i.e. units that hold the assets (own-
ing controlling-levels of equity) of a group of
subsidiary corporations and whose principal
activity is owning the group. The holding com-
panies in this class do not provide any other
service to the businesses in which the equity
is held, i.e. they do not administer or manage
other units.
Such units are captive financial institutions and are
included in the financial corporations sector even if
all the subsidiaries are nonfinancial corporations. The
subsidiaries may be resident in the same economy or in
other economies.
4.85 Another type of unit referred to as a holding
company is the head office that exercises some aspects
of managerial control over its subsidiaries. The head
office sometimes may have noticeably fewer employ-
ees, and at a more senior level, than its subsidiaries,
but it is actively engaged in production. These types of
activities are described in ISIC , Rev. 4, in section M
class 7010 as follows:
This class includes the overseeing and manag-
ing of other units of the company or enterprise;
undertaking the strategic or organizational
planning and decision making role of the com-
pany or enterprise; exercising operational con-
trol and managing the day-to-day operations of
their related units.
Such units are allocated to the nonfinancial corpora-
tions sector unless all or most of their subsidiaries are
financial corporations, in which case they are treated
by convention as financial auxiliaries. The subsidiaries
may be resident in the same economy or in other econo-
mies. Other entities that hold and manage subsidiaries
may have substantial operations in their own right, in
which case the holding company functions may be sec-
ondary, so they would be classified according to their
predominant operations.
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence
Conduits
4.86 A conduit is an entity that raises funds on open
financial markets for passing on to other affiliated
enterprises. Often, the conduit’s liabilities are guar-
anteed by a parent company. If a conduit issues new
financial instruments, which could be debt securities,
shares, or partnership interests, that represent a claim
on the conduit, it is acting as a captive financial insti-
tution. (Conduits are a case of “pass-through funds,”
discussed in paragraph 6.34.)

Wealth-holding entities
4.87 Institutional units that solely hold assets and lia-
bilities, along with the associated property income, for
their owners are classified as captive financial institutions.
Some SPEs and trusts perform these functions. SPEs
are discussed further in paragraphs 4.50–4.52. Although
there is no internationally standard definition of SPEs,
in economies in which they are important they may be
identified separately, according to either a national com-
pany law definition, or in terms of a functional descrip-
tion, possibly referring to their limited physical presence
and ownership by nonresidents. In economies with large
direct investment flows through resident SPEs, it is rec-
ommended that these flows be shown as a supplementary
item, so that they can be identified separately.

Insurance corporations
4.88 Insurance corporations consist of incorpo-
rated, mutual, and other entities whose principal func-
tion is to provide life, accident, health, fire, or other
forms of insurance to individual institutional units or
groups of units or reinsurance services to other insur-
ance corporations. Captive insurance is included, that
is, an insurance company that serves only its owners.
Deposit insurers, issuers of deposit guarantees, deposit
protection schemes, and other issuers of standardized
guarantees that are separate entities and act like insurers
by charging premiums and have reserves are classified
as insurance corporations. (The relevant specialized
instruments—nonlife insurance technical reserves, and
life insurance and annuity entitlements—are discussed
in paragraphs 5.64–5.65.)

Pension funds
4.89 Pension liabilities arise when members of
households participate in a social insurance scheme
that will provide income in retirement (and often ben-
efits for death or disability). Such schemes may be
organized by employers or by government; they also

may be organized by insurance corporations on behalf
of employees; or separate institutional units may be
established to hold and manage the assets to be used to
meet the pension obligations and to distribute the pen-
sions. Pension schemes may be operated by a separately
constituted pension fund or a fund that is part of the
employer, or they may be unfunded. The pension fund
subsector consists of only those social insurance pen-
sion funds that are institutional units separate from the
units that create them.
4.90 Social security schemes are not included in
pension funds, although they sometimes may have pen-
sion entitlement liabilities if they provide pensions to
public sector employees. In the case of unfunded pen-
sion schemes, general government and corporations
other than pension funds may have pension entitlement
liabilities. Nonautonomous pension funds are not sepa-
rated from the entity of which they are part. (Pension
entitlements as a type of financial asset or liability are
discussed in paragraph 5.66.)
c. General government
4.91 Government units are unique kinds of legal
entities established by political processes and have
legislative, judicial, or executive authority over other
institutional units within a given area. Viewed as insti-
tutional units, the principal functions of government
are to assume responsibility for the provision of goods
and services to the community or individual households
and to finance their provision out of taxation or other
incomes; to redistribute income and wealth by means
of transfers; and to engage in nonmarket production. In
general terms:
(a) A government usually has the authority to raise
funds by collecting taxes or compulsory trans-
fers from other institutional units.
(b) Government units typically make three differ-
ent kinds of outlays. The first group consists of
actual or imputed expenditures on the free provi-
sion to the community of collective services, such
as public administration, defense, law enforce-
ment, public health, and so on. The second group
consists of expenditures on the provision of goods
and services for free or at prices that are not eco-
nomically significant. The third group consists of
transfers to other institutional units that are made
to redistribute income or wealth.
Within a single territory, many separate government
units may exist when there are different levels of gov-
ernment, specifically central, state, or local govern-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

ment. In addition, social security funds also constitute
government units.

4.92 The general government sector consists of depart-
ments, branches, agencies, foundations, institutes, non-
market nonprofit institutions controlled by government,
and other publicly controlled organizations engaging in
nonmarket activities. As discussed in paragraph 4.5, the
operations of a government that are located abroad and
that are largely exempt from the laws of the territory
in which they are located, such as embassies, consul-
ates, and military bases, are a part of the home gov-
ernment. Government units are mainly involved in the
production of goods and services that may be provided
free of charge or sold at prices that are not economi-
cally significant. Government-controlled enterprises that
(a) produce market output (i.e., charge prices that are
economically significant), and (b) have complete sets of
accounts are excluded from general government and are
included as public enterprises in the appropriate nonfi-
nancial or financial corporations sector. The requirement
that prices be economically significant means that prices
must be high enough to have an impact on the demand
for, and supply of, a good or service.^7

Government entities resident abroad
4.93 If a government uses an entity that is resident in
the economic territory of another government to carry
out general government activities (i.e., fiscal activities,
rather than for a public corporation, as defined in para-
graph 4.108), that entity is not included as part of the
general government in either its economy of residence
or the economy of the government that uses the entity.
Such entities are not treated in the same way as embas-
sies and other territorial enclaves if they are created
and operate under the laws of the host economy. As
noted in paragraph 6.20(d), governments may be direct
investors in these cases. However, as noted in para-
graphs 8.24–8.26, 11.40, and 12.48, special imputations
of transactions and positions between the government
and the entity are adopted to ensure that any fiscal
operations undertaken through nonresident entities are
reflected in the transactions and positions of the gov-
ernment concerned.

(^7) The classification of a “special purpose government fund” con-
trolled by government in the general government or financial cor-
porations sectors is determined according to the criteria set out in
paragraphs 4.63–4.92, such as whether they charge economically
significant prices for their services. If the fund is an entity incorpo-
rated abroad or quasi-corporation located abroad, it is classified as
a separate institutional unit in the financial corporations sector resi-
dent in its economy of incorporation. See also paragraphs 6.93–6.98
for more information on “special purpose government funds.”
Restructuring agencies
4.94 Restructuring agencies are entities set up to
sell corporations and other assets, and to reorganize
companies. They also may be used for defeasance of
impaired assets or repayment of liabilities of insol-
vent entities, often in the context of a banking crisis.
Restructuring agencies are involved in such activities
as managing liabilities and their repayment, managing
impaired assets and their sale on the market, and in the
financing of the process.
4.95 When the restructuring agency is government
funded and is considered not to be putting itself at risk,
for example, because the debt liabilities it manages are
disproportionately large relative to the fair value of its
assets, then it is considered to be operating for fiscal
purposes, rather than on a commercial basis, so that
the agency is part of the general government sector.
For instance, if a restructuring agency deliberately pur-
chases assets at above-market prices with direct or indi-
rect financial support from the government and does
not place itself at risk, it is considered to be operating
for fiscal purposes and therefore should be classified in
the general government sector. Otherwise, it is classified
as a financial corporation according to the nature of its
operations, usually in the subsector other financial inter-
mediaries except ICPFs. For instance, if the restructuring
agency borrows on the market at its own risk to acquire
financial or nonfinancial assets that it actively manages,
the unit should be classified as a financial corporation.
Asset management companies that acquire, manage, and
dispose of impaired bank assets, and that are considered
to be putting themselves at risk, are classified this way.
d. Households
Reference:
2008 SNA , Chapter 24, The Households Sector.
4.96 A household is defined as a group of persons
who share the same living accommodation, who pool
some or all of their income and wealth, and who con-
sume certain types of goods and services collectively,
mainly housing and food. Households often coincide
with families. However, members of a family are not
always members of the same household, if they live
separately. Equally, members of the same household
do not necessarily have to belong to the same family if
they share resources and consumption.
4.97 Households may be of any size and take a
wide variety of different forms in different societies
or cultures depending on tradition, religion, education,
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence

climate, geography, history, and other socioeconomic
factors. Institutional households include persons in
retirement homes, jails, hospitals, and religious orders.

4.98 Although each member of a household is a
legal entity, the household is an appropriate unit for
statistical purposes because many economic decisions
are made at the household level and transactions within
the household are outside the scope of economic sta-
tistics. The members of a household are all residents
in the same economic territory. A person who pools
income with the household in one economic territory,
but is resident of another economic territory, is not clas-
sified as a member of that household. A single person
can constitute a household.

4.99 The households sector includes enterprises
owned by household members that do not satisfy the
definition of a quasi-corporation. For example, if the
business affairs of a household are not separable from
the personal consumption of household members,
then the business would not satisfy the requirements
for a quasi-corporation to have the ability to produce
accounts. (Some unincorporated businesses are treated
as quasi-corporations, as discussed in paragraphs 4.34–
4.40 and 4.49.)

e. Nonprofit institutions serving households

Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 23, Non-profit Institutions in the
SNA.
4.100 NPISHs are entities mainly engaged in pro-
viding goods and services to households or the com-
munity at large free of charge or at prices that are not
economically significant (and thus are classified as
nonmarket producers), except those that are controlled
and mainly financed by government units. Examples
include charities, relief and aid organizations financed
by voluntary transfers, as well as trade unions, profes-
sional or learned societies, consumers’ associations,
religious institutions, and social, cultural, and recre-
ational clubs that do not charge economically signifi-
cant prices. They may be corporations, foundations,
trusts, or other unincorporated entities.

4.101 NPISHs are mainly financed from contri-
butions, subscriptions from members, or earnings on
holdings of real or financial assets. The NPISH sector
is a subset of nonprofit institutions. Those that charge
economically significant prices are included in the
financial or nonfinancial corporations or households
sectors, as relevant. Additionally, nonprofit institutions

serving businesses, such as chambers of commerce and
trade associations, are included in the corporations sec-
tors (see paragraph 12.57 on their membership dues).
When this Manual refers to nonprofit institutions, it
includes all nonprofit institutions.
f. Rest of the world
4.102 The rest of the world consists of all nonresi-
dent institutional units that enter into transactions with
resident units or that have other economic links with
resident units. The rest of the world sector is identified
in the national accounts, while it is the counterparty in
all international accounts items.
International organizations
4.103 International organizations have the following
characteristics:
(a) The members of an international organization are
either national states or other international orga-
nizations whose members are national states;
they thus derive their authority either directly
from the national states that are their members or
indirectly from them through other international
organizations.
(b) They are entities established by formal political
agreements between their members that have the
status of international treaties; their existence is
recognized by law in their member countries.
(c) International organizations are created for vari-
ous purposes:
International financial organizations—these
entities conduct financial intermediation at
an international level (i.e., channeling funds
between lenders and borrowers in different
economies). A central bank to a group of
economies (including currency union central
banks) is an example of an international finan-
cial organization. Other examples are the IMF,
World Bank Group, BIS, and regional devel-
opment banks; and
Other international organizations—these enti-
ties provide nonmarket services of a collective
nature for the benefit of their member states,
such as peacekeeping, education, science, pol-
icy issues, and other research.
4.104 International organizations may be global or
regional. An international agency responsible for func-
tions normally undertaken by general government, such
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

as administration and policing, is classified as an inter-
national organization, but it may be useful to identify
such agencies separately in statistics.

4.105 International organizations are treated as
not being resident of the territories in which they are
located. This treatment is because they are generally
exempted from, or are only partially subject to, national
laws or regulations, and so they are not considered to
be part of the national economy of the territory, or ter-
ritories, in which they are located.

4.106 International organizations may be presented
as an institutional sector in some cases. First, they may
appear in data for a currency union or economic union, in
which case, international organizations of the union are
residents of the union as a whole. Second, they may be
of relevance when data by sector of counterparty are pre-
pared, for example, for sources of current transfers. Such
data would be of particular interest in economies in which
international organizations have a substantial presence.

4.107 In contrast to international organizations,
enterprises owned jointly by two or more governments
are not treated as international organizations but like
other enterprises. The distinction is based on whether
the organization produces for the market and is impor-
tant because of the different treatments for the residence
of international organizations and enterprises. Separate
pension funds for the staff of international organizations
are treated as pension funds, rather than as international
organizations. Therefore, the residence of these pension
funds is determined in accord with paragraph 4.141.

g. Additional detail for public corporations

Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 4, Institutional Units and Sectors,
and Chapter 22, The General Government and
Public Sectors.

4.108 A corporation is a public corporation if a gov-
ernment unit, another public corporation, or some com-
bination of government units and public corporations
controls the entity, where control is defined as the ability
to determine the general corporate policy of the cor-
poration. The expression “general corporate policy” as
used here is understood in a broad sense to mean the key
financial and operating policies relating to the corpora-
tion’s strategic objectives as a market producer. (This use
of public corporation as a term should be distinguished
from the use of the same term to refer to a public corpo-
ration whose shares are traded on public markets.) Public
corporations may be shown as “of which” items for the

financial and nonfinancial corporations sectors or sub-
sectors as supplementary items, when relevant.
4.109 Because governments exercise sovereign powers
through legislation, regulations, orders, and the like, care
needs to be applied in determining whether the exercise
of such powers amounts to a determination of the general
corporate policy of a particular corporation and therefore
control of the corporation. Laws and regulations applica-
ble to all units as a class or to a particular industry should
not be viewed as amounting to control of these units. The
ability to determine the general corporate policy does
not necessarily include the direct control of the day-to-
day activities or operations of a particular corporation.
Because the arrangements for the control of corporations
can vary considerably, it is neither desirable nor feasible
to prescribe a definitive list of factors to be taken into
account. The following eight indicators, however, will nor-
mally be the most important factors to consider:
(a) ownership of the majority of the voting interest;
(b) control of the board or other governing body;
(c) control of the appointment and removal of key
personnel;
(d) control of key committees of the entity;
(e) golden shares and options (golden shares give the
holder a decisive vote, even without a majority
of shares);
(f) regulation and control;
(g) control by a dominant customer; and
(h) control attached to borrowing from the
government.
4.110 Although a single indicator could be sufficient
to establish control, in other cases, a number of separate
indicators may collectively indicate control. A decision
based on the totality of all indicators must necessarily
be judgmental in nature. International accounts com-
pilers should consult with government finance statisti-
cians to ensure consistent treatments.
4.111 Public-private partnerships are long-term con-
tracts, whereby a private entity acquires or builds an
asset, operates it for a period, and then hands it over
to a government. The private entity may be a direct
investment enterprise. These schemes may be called
private finance initiatives; build, own, operate, transfer
(BOOT) schemes; and so on. As with leases, the eco-
nomic owner of the assets related to such an arrange-
ment is determined by assessing which unit bears the
majority of the risks and which unit is expected to
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence
receive a majority of the rewards of the assets. More
details are available in 2008 SNA , Chapter 22.

4.112 Corporations subject to the control of a gov-
ernment that is resident in a different economy from
that government are not classified as public corpora-
tions. They receive this treatment because they are not
public companies related to the government of their
economy of residence. These corporations differ from
embassies and military bases in that they are subject
to local laws and so should be seen as part of their
economy of location.

E. Residence
1. General principles

Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 4, Institutional Units and Sectors,
and Chapter 26, The Rest of the World Accounts.
4.113 The residence of each institutional unit is the
economic territory with which it has the strongest con-
nection, expressed as its center of predominant eco-
nomic interest. Each institutional unit is a resident of
one and only one economic territory determined by
its center of predominant economic interest. Specific
criteria for determining residence are given below. The
definitions given below are designed to apply the con-
cept of center of predominant economic interest. These
definitions should be used in preference to a discre-
tionary choice between different possible aspects of
economic interest.

4.114 An institutional unit is resident in an economic
territory when there exists, within the economic terri-
tory, some location, dwelling, place of production, or
other premises on which or from which the unit engages
and intends to continue engaging, either indefinitely
or over a finite but long period of time, in economic
activities and transactions on a significant scale. The
location need not be fixed so long as it remains within
the economic territory. Actual or intended location for
one year or more is used as an operational definition;
although the choice of one year as a specific period is
somewhat arbitrary, it is adopted to avoid uncertainty
and facilitate international consistency.

4.115 In overview, residence of selected entities is
as follows, subject to the more detailed elaboration in
paragraphs 4.116–4.144:

(a) The residence of individual persons is determined
by that of the household of which they are a part
and not by their place of work. All members of
the same household have the same residence as
the household itself, even though they may cross
borders to work or otherwise spend periods of
time abroad. If they work and reside abroad so
that they acquire a center of predominant eco-
nomic interest abroad, they cease to be members
of their original households.
(b) Unincorporated enterprises that are not quasi-
corporations are not separate institutional units
from their owners and, therefore, have the same
residence as their owners. (However, the crite-
ria for recognizing a branch in paragraph 4.27
mean that significant cross-border businesses
will almost always be recognized as quasi-
corporations.)
(c) Corporations and nonprofit institutions normally
may be expected to have a center of economic
interest in the economy in which they are legally
constituted and registered. Corporations may be
resident in economies different from their share-
holders and subsidiaries may be resident in dif-
ferent economies from their parent corporations.
When a corporation, or unincorporated enter-
prise, maintains a branch, office, or production
site in another territory to engage in a significant
amount of production over a long period of time
(usually one year or more) but without creating
a corporation for the purpose, the branch, office,
or site is considered to be a quasi-corporation
(i.e., a separate institutional unit) resident in the
territory in which it is located.
(d) For entities, such as many SPEs, that have few if
any attributes of location, the residence is deter-
mined by their place of incorporation.
(e) When a nonresident has ownership of land and
buildings, and natural resources other than land,
the assets are deemed to be owned by a notional
resident institutional unit in the economy of loca-
tion, even if they do not engage in other eco-
nomic activities or transactions in the economy.
All land, buildings, and natural resources other
than land are therefore owned by residents.
2. Residence of households
4.116 Although many people are clearly strongly
connected to only one economy, others have substantial
economic interests in two or more economic territo-
ries. Factors such as location of dwellings, employment,
asset holdings, citizenship, migration status, income tax

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

status, income received, expenditure, business interests,
and location of dependent family members may point
to different economies. To identify the economy of
residence when there are connections to two or more
economies, the following definition is used to identify
the center of predominant economic interest.

4.117 A household is resident in the economic terri-
tory in which household members maintain or intend to
maintain a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated
and used by members of the household as their prin-
cipal dwelling. Being present for one year or more in
a territory or intending to do so is sufficient to qualify
as having a principal dwelling there. If there is uncer-
tainty about which dwelling is the principal dwelling, it
is identified from the length of time spent there, rather
than other factors such as presence of other family
members, cost, size, or length of tenure.

4.118 Individuals who belong to the same household
must be residents of the same territory. If a member of
an existing household ceases to reside in the territory
where his or her household is resident, the individual
ceases to be a member of that household. As a result of
this definition, the use of households as the institutional
unit is compatible with residence being determined on
an individual basis.

4.119 Further to the general principles, some other
factors are used to determine residence of particular cat-
egories. These categories are students, medical patients,
ship’s crew, as well as national diplomats, military per-
sonnel, staff of scientific stations, and other civil ser-
vants employed abroad in government enclaves (these
enclaves are discussed in paragraph 4.5(e)). In these
cases, some other connections are considered to be more
important in determining residence. In the case of sig-
nificant population movements between two particular
territories, compilers in each territory should cooperate
to ensure consistent definitions and measurement.

Students

4.120 People who go abroad for full-time study gener-
ally continue to be resident in the territory in which they
were resident prior to studying abroad. This treatment is
adopted even though their course of study may exceed a
year. However, students change to being residents of the
territory in which they are studying when they develop
an intention to continue their presence in the territory of
study after the completion of the studies. For students,
the rationale for not changing the territory of residence is
that the movement to the different territory is considered
to have a temporary motivation, that is, their center of

predominant economic interest remains with the home
territory. The residence of accompanying dependents of
students is determined in the same manner as the per-
sons they accompany. The tuition and other expenditure
of students in their host economies are included in travel
(see paragraph 10.89).
Patients
4.121 People who go abroad for the purpose of
medical treatment maintain their predominant center
of interest in the territory in which they were resident
before they received the treatment, even in the rare
cases in which complex treatments take a year or more.
As with students, the movement is considered to have a
temporary motivation. The residence of accompanying
dependents of patients is determined in the same man-
ner as the persons they accompany.
Crew of ships and so on
4.122 Crew of ships, aircraft, oil rigs, space sta-
tions, or other similar equipment that operate outside
a territory or across several territories are treated as
being resident in their home base territory. The home
base is determined from where they spend most time
other than undertaking their duties. The home base is
regarded as a stronger connection than the location of
the mobile equipment or its operator, even though most
of the time may be spent at the latter location.
Diplomats, military personnel, and so on
4.123 National diplomats, peacekeeping and other
military personnel, and other civil servants employed
abroad in government enclaves, as well as members
of their households are considered to be residents of
the economic territory of the employing government.
Those enclaves—military bases, embassies, and the
like, as discussed in paragraph 4.5(e) —form part of
the economic territory of the employing government.
They continue to be residents in their home economies
even if they live in dwellings outside the enclaves. The
expenditure of diplomats and so on in their host econo-
mies is included in government goods and services
n.i.e. (see paragraph 10.177). Other employees, such as
locally recruited staff, are resident in the location of
their principal dwelling.
International organization staff
4.124 Staff of international organizations, including
those with diplomatic status and military personnel,
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence
are resident in the territory of their principal dwelling.
The treatment of international organization staff is dif-
ferent from national diplomats and others discussed in
the previous paragraph because the latter continue to be
paid from and directed by their home government and
tend to have shorter postings and rotate back to their
economy of origin.

Cross-border workers

4.125 Border workers, seasonal workers, and other
short-term workers cross borders for a short period to
undertake a job. No special treatment is adopted, so
their residence is determined according to the criteria
in paragraph 4.117. Border workers are employed per-
sons who cross from one territory to another to attend
their place of employment. Seasonal workers cross the
border for particular periods, such as the harvest or
tourist seasons to attend a place of employment. Other
short-term employment may occur for a particular
task, such as a construction project, repairs, delivery
of advice, and so on. In each case, the residence of the
persons concerned is based on the principal dwelling,
rather than the territory of employment.

Highly mobile individuals

4.126 Some individuals have close connections with
two or more territories, for example, they have dwellings
in more than one territory in which they spend signifi-
cant amounts of time. For individuals who do not have
continuous actual or intended presence in any one terri-
tory for one year, the territory of the principal dwelling
they maintain is the key consideration. In cases of no
principal dwelling, or two or more principal dwellings in
different economies, the territory of residence is deter-
mined on the basis of the territory in which the predomi-
nant amount of time is spent in the year. Although these
individuals need to be classified as residents of a single
economy for statistical purposes, additional information
may be needed in recognition of strong ties to another
economy. The statistical result of classifying long-term
guest workers as residents of the host economy is appro-
priate, however, in that their income and consumption in
the host territory are not treated as international trans-
actions, only the amounts actually sent to the home
economy are. The alternative would involve artificial
rerouting—the income credits and travel debits would be
attributed to the home territory.

4.127 Nevertheless, it may be desirable for compil-
ers to provide supplementary data on groups of non-
residents that have significant links with the economy,

for example, by remitting funds to family members
remaining there or by intending to return there with
savings or pension entitlements. Similarly, it may be
desirable to have supplementary data on those who
are classified as residents of the economy, but main-
tain significant links to other economies. Appendix 5
discusses some supplementary presentations for flows
associated with some of these mobile individuals.
Refugees
4.128 No special treatment is adopted for refugees.
Their residence will change from their home territory
to the territory of refuge, if they have stayed or intend to
stay in their place of refuge for one year or more, even if
that residence is involuntary or transient, and its future
status is unclear.
Application of residence principles
4.129 In practice, residence principles are generally
not applied to specific individuals, but to broad groups
of people. As a result, factors such as intention to stay
for one year or more are typically inferred from pat-
terns of similar groups in the past. Some administrative
data sources may vary somewhat from statistical defi-
nitions of residence. If the variations are significant,
some adjustment may be made, or the administrative
definition may be considered as an acceptable approxi-
mation in practice.
4.130 The determination of residence results in how
the income, expenditure, and financial positions of
the households concerned are treated in international
accounts statistics. Table 4.3 provides a brief summary
of some of the implications for the international accounts
of whether a household is classified as resident or non-
resident of the reporting economy for different types of
flows. For example, a nonresident student studying in a
territory is shown as being a source of service credits
for education, housing, food, other goods and services,
and possibly transfer debits, if the student is receiving
a scholarship from the host economy. For a resident
student, these transactions would be out of scope of the
international accounts. The effect of changes of resi-
dence of persons is discussed in paragraph 4.165.
3. Residence of enterprises
4.131 As a general principle, an enterprise is resi-
dent in an economic territory when the enterprise is
engaged in a significant amount of production of goods
or services from a location in the territory. Additional

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

principles are spelled out in paragraphs 4.134–4.136.
As stated in paragraph 4.23, an enterprise is an institu-
tional unit engaged in production and may be a corpora-
tion or quasi-corporation, a nonprofit institution, or an
unincorporated enterprise (part of household sector).

4.132 In contrast to individuals and households,
which may have connections to two or more economies,
enterprises are almost always connected to a single
economy. Taxation and other legal requirements tend
to result in the use of a separate legal entity for opera-
tions in each legal jurisdiction. In addition, a separate
institutional unit is identified for statistical purposes
in cases in which a single legal entity has substantial
operations in two or more territories (e.g., for branches,
land ownership, and multiterritory enterprises, as noted
in paragraphs 4.26–4.44). As a result of splitting such
legal entities, the residence of each of the subsequently
identified enterprises is clear. The introduction of the
terminology “center of predominant economic interest”
does not mean that entities with substantial operations
in two or more territories no longer need to be split.

4.133 It is generally required that production take
place or is planned to take place in the territory over a
period of a year or more for a quasi-corporation to be
identified. All enterprises must be resident somewhere,
however, so if an actual institutional unit’s only activity
is a production process that is undertaken over a shorter
period, the unit is resident in the territory of location of
the production.

Corporations with little or no physical presence
4.134 A legal entity is resident in the economic ter-
ritory under whose laws the entity is incorporated or
registered. If it is a resident artificial subsidiary, it is
combined with a parent resident in the same economy
to form an institutional unit (paragraph 4.18) or, for
some purposes, combined into a local enterprise group
(paragraph 4.55). However, it must not be combined
with entities resident in other economies. If it has sub-
stantial operations in another economy, a branch may
be identified there (paragraph 4.26). In some cases,
a corporation has little or no physical presence, for
example, its administration is entirely contracted out to
other entities. Banking, insurance, investment funds (as
distinct from their managers), securitization vehicles,
and some SPEs often operate this way. Similarly, with
virtual manufacturing, all the physical processes are
outsourced to other units.
4.135 A single corporation might be registered
in several jurisdictions, for example, incorporation,
income tax, value-added tax, and particular regula-
tions, and a jurisdiction may have been agreed on for
settling disputes involving the enterprise. In such cases,
the jurisdiction of the laws that govern the creation and
continued existence of the entity should be used as the
criterion for determining residence. If there is no incor-
poration or registration, legal domicile is used as a cri-
terion. The incorporation and registration represents a
substantial degree of connection to the economy, asso-

and operations. In contrast, other connections such as
ownership, location of assets, or location of managers
or administration may be less clear-cut.

Production delivered from a base

4.136 In some cases, an enterprise has a location that
is used as a base to deliver services to other locations.
For example, this mode is used for transport (discussed
under mobile equipment in paragraph 4.31) and also may
be used for delivery of many kinds of services, such
as on-site repairs, short-term construction, and many
types of business services. In such cases, the residence of
the enterprise is determined from its base of operations,
rather than the point of delivery or location of mobile
equipment, unless the activities at the point of delivery
are sufficiently substantial to amount to a branch, as
defined in paragraph 4.27. For example, an institutional
unit that operates ships on the high seas and various ter-
ritorial waters has its residence determined according to
the criteria in paragraphs 4.131–4.135, and the economy
of residence is not necessarily the same as the location
where the ships spend the most time or the territory of
registration of the ships. Additionally, the enterprise that
operates the ships is not necessarily the same as the
enterprise that owns the ships, such as where the ship
operator has an operating lease from the ship owner,
who is resident in another economy. The residence of

the enterprise that owns the ship is determined accord-
ing to the criteria in paragraphs 4.131–4.135. Flags of
convenience used by enterprises do not determine the
residence of the operator, and indeed a single shipping
operator may have ships registered in several econo-
mies. Similarly, the residence of enterprises that charter
ships is determined by the location of its own base of
operations, rather than the flags or locations of particular
ships. The base of operations does not necessarily equate
to the location from which the enterprise is managed. A
company operating mobile equipment may be legally
domiciled in one economy but managed from another
economy.
4.137 Table 4.4 provides a brief summary of some
of the implications for the international accounts of
whether an enterprise is treated as a resident enterprise
or as a nonresident for different types of flows and
positions. The possibility of change of residence by
enterprises is discussed in paragraph 4.167.
4. Residence of other institutional units
a. General government
4.138 General government includes operations out-
side the home territory, such as embassies, consulates,
military bases, and other enclaves of foreign govern-
ments, including those providing training and other
forms of assistance. Usually, these operations are not

separate institutional units, but even if they were, they
are residents of their home territory, rather than the
host territory in which they are physically located. This
treatment is adopted because they usually have some
degree of immunity from the host territory’s laws and
are deemed under international law to be extensions of
the home government’s territory. However, an entity
created by a government under the laws of the host
ju r isd ict ion is a n ent er pr ise resident i n t he host e conomy
and not part of the general government sector in either
economy. (See also paragraph 4.93 for further discus-
sion of such cases.) The residence of the employees of
these operations is discussed in paragraph 4.123.

b. International organizations

4.139 International organizations are defined in
paragraphs 4.103–4.107. International organizations are
resident in an economic territory of their own, and not
of the economy in which they are physically located.
This treatment applies to both international organiza-
tions located in only one territory and those located in
two or more territories. The residence of the employees
of these operations is discussed in paragraph 4.124.

4.140 An international organization that operates
peacekeeping and other military forces or that acts as
the interim administration in a territory remains classi-
fied as an international organization and is nonresident
in that territory, even if it undertakes general govern-
ment functions. In cases in which these organizations
are significant, it may be desirable to identify them
separately.

4.141 A separately constituted pension fund of an
international organization is not treated as an inter-
national organization, but it is regarded as a financial
corporation. Its residence is determined according to
the general principles in paragraphs 4.131–4.135—that
is, it is a resident of the territory in which it is located,
and if it lacks a physical presence, it is a resident of the
economy in which it is incorporated or registered.

c. Regional international organizations

4.142 Some international organizations cover a
group of economies in a particular region, such as with
economic or currency unions. If statistics are prepared
for that region as a whole, these regional organizations
are residents of the region as a whole, even though they
are not residents of any member economy (see Appen-
dix 3 for further information in the case of currency
and economic unions).

4.143 When producing global or regional totals,
international organizations are combined with national
data when deriving global and regional totals, such as
for the international transactions and positions com-
piled by the IMF.
d. NPISHs
4.144 An NPISH has a center of economic interest
in the economy in which the institution was legally cre-
ated and is officially recognized and recorded as a legal
or social entity. In practice, residence of the vast major-
ity of NPISHs may be determined without ambiguity.
When an NPISH is engaged in charity or relief work
on an international scale, it may maintain substantial
operations for individual territories that may amount
to branches (see discussion in paragraph 4.27). Such
a branch is usually financed largely or entirely by cur-
rent or capital transfers from abroad. NPISHs are not
international organizations, which are limited to those
created by governments.
F. Issues Associated with Residence
1. Assets and liabilities held by groups that
include both residents and nonresidents

4.145 Some financial assets have owners who are
residents of different economic territories. Examples
include joint bank accounts or other cases in which an
account holder authorizes relatives to withdraw funds
from the account. In these cases, the allocation between
the owners may be unclear:
In the case of deposits of emigrant workers in their
home economies that are freely usable by fam-
ily members resident in the home economies, a
convention can be adopted to treat these assets as
being held by residents of the home economy.
Similarly, for deposits of emigrant workers in the
host economy that are freely usable by family mem-
bers, a convention can be adopted to treat these as
being held by a resident of the host economy.
(See Monetary and Financial Statistics Compilation
Guide , paragraph 3.46.)
Compilers may adopt another treatment if better infor-
mation is available. Because these accounts may be
used to make transfers, it is important that such transac-
tions are recognized at either the time of deposit or time
of withdrawal (depending on the convention adopted).
It is also important that compilers discuss methods with
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence
the compilers of monetary and financial statistics and
compilers in the counterpart economy with a view to
adopting consistent and realistic treatments in cases in
which the values are significant.

2. Data by partner economy

4.146 The primary presentation of international
accounts shows positions and transactions with all non-
residents as a total, but data on positions and transactions
with nonresidents broken down into individual partner
economies or groups of economies are of considerable
interest. (The possible split of data by partner institu-
tional sector is discussed in paragraph 4.57.) Data may
be provided for the balance of payments or IIP as a
whole, or for particular components, such as goods, ser-
vices, direct investment, or portfolio investment. As well
as for economic analysis, partner data make bilateral
comparisons possible and, hence, assist in identifying
data problems. For example, partner data are an essential
element of the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey and Coordinated Direct Investment Survey as
well as the BIS’s international banking statistics.

4.147 Partner data are often prepared for groups of
economies or a mix of groupings and major individual
partner economies. (Because partner economies are
often grouped into regions, the data are sometimes
called regional statements.) It is desirable to follow
standard lists of economies and regions, such as those of
the United Nations or IMF. The partner data published
may be aggregated to groups of economies because of
confidentiality and to avoid categories with minimal
values. In addition to economies and regions, categories
for international organizations as counterparties are
needed. Partner data are also necessary to consolidate
data from member states into data for a currency union.
Additional information on partner data is dealt with in
paragraphs A3.21–A3.28.

4.148 The basic principle for data by partner econ-
omy is based on the economy of residence of the coun-
terparty to the transaction or financial position. The
same principles for determining residence, as discussed
in Section E of this chapter, are applicable, but they are
often more difficult to apply because the information
is not known to the resident counterparty. In a number
of cases listed in paragraphs 4.149–4.164, the main
potential source of information may fall short of the
preferred basis. In each case, such divergences should
be noted by compilers and their significance assessed
to determine whether adjustments are needed. The bal-
ance of payments statement as a whole is conceptually
balanced because each transaction involves two equal

flows; however, bilateral balance of payments may not
balance (even in theory) (see paragraph A3.73).
a. Agents
4.149 An agent is a party who acts on behalf of
or as a representative for another party. Transactions
arranged by an agent on behalf of a principal should
be attributed to the principal, not to the agent. For
example, if an agent issues tickets on behalf of an air-
line resident in another economy, the transactions and
positions related to those tickets are attributed to the
airline. However, an agent also may undertake transac-
tions on its own account, including the agency services
it provides to the principal.
b. Goods
4.150 In line with the change of ownership prin-
ciple, the residence of the seller or purchaser of the
good is the preferred concept for identification of the
partner. In practice, available data may be based on the
economy of origin,^8 consignment, destination, or other
criteria that, in some cases, may differ from the econ-
omy of the seller or purchaser. In general, the economy
of final destination (for the partner to exports) is con-
sidered to be more likely to correspond with the party
taking ownership of the goods. Similarly, the economy
of origin (for the partner to imports) is considered to
be more likely to correspond with the party convey-
ing ownership of the goods. However, economy of ori-
gin, destination, and consignment can be misleading
as to ownership in cases of merchanting and goods
processed on a fee basis. In those cases, adjustments
should be considered to accord with the change of own-
ership principle as much as possible.
c. Freight and insurance
4.151 Freight and insurance beyond the frontiers of
the exporter are imputed in international accounts sta-
tistics as being payable by the importer, even if payable
by the exporter, wholesaler, or other third party. In
practice, data may be recorded on other bases, such as
the economy of source or destination of the goods car-
ried, or the registration of the ship. In cases in which
this occurs, adjustments for the effect of these factors
should be made, where possible.
(^8) Economy of origin is defined in International Merchandise
Trade Statistics: Concepts and Definitions , paragraph 139, as where
the goods were wholly produced, or where there was “substantial
transformation” in cases of production taking place in two or more
economies.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

d. Financial instruments

4.152 Partner data on asset positions are classified to
the partner economy according to the residence of the
issuer, not other factors such as the place of issue, the
residence of a guarantor, or the currency of issue. Simi-
larly, partner data on liability positions are classified
according to the residence of the holders. In practice,
identification of counterparty for securities positions,
income, and transactions is difficult for various reasons,
including that (a) the issuer is not always aware of current
holders of securities, (b) transactors in securities markets
may not be aware of the identity of the counterparty, and
(c) security holders may be unaware that income on
securities positions may be payable by a financial inter-
mediary that created a “short” or reverse position in the
security rather than by the issuer of the security.

4.153 Classification of balance of payments transac-
tions in financial instruments by partner raises some
additional issues to those for the IIP, in terms of data
availability and user interest. These issues arise when
an existing instrument is sold by a holder to another
party. Such transactions involve only an exchange of
assets, in contrast to the initial issue of a new instru-
ment, which involves the creation of a new liability.
This situation applies not only to securities, but also to
other instruments that are traded, such as loans, depos-
its, banknotes, and coin.

4.154 For balance of payments transactions, the
partner attribution could be made on the basis of the
parties to the transaction (namely, the buyer and the
seller, the so-called transactor approach), or for assets
owned, the residence of the issuer (the so-called debtor-
creditor approach). In these cases, it is acceptable to
adopt a convention for partner attribution of assets
owned based on the residence of either the counterparty
to the transaction or the issuer. On practical grounds,
the information available does not always permit iden-
tification of the two parties to the transaction. As noted
in paragraph 14.24, both the debtor-creditor and trans-
actor bases could be of analytical interest. (See also
paragraphs 3.7–3.8.)

e. Securities

4.155 The partner attribution of a liability position or
issue of a liability is made on the basis of the residence
of the issuer. In cases in which a security is issued in
a market other than where the issuer is resident, there
is a need for particular attention. For example, for debt
securities, the security identification number could be
based on the economy of issue.

f. Direct investment
4.156 For direct investment, there can be chains of
voting power, such as when a direct investor in Econ-
omy A has a subsidiary in Economy B, which in turn
has a subsidiary in Economy C. In this case, for the
direct investment in Economy C
(a) the economy of immediate ownership is Econ-
omy B; and
(b) the ultimate investing economy is Economy A.
As a basic principle, direct investment transactions
and positions by partner economy should be reported
according to the immediate host or investing economy,
based on the direct relationships between the parties
rather than based on the residence of the ultimate part-
ner economies or transactors. The partner allocation is
based on the economy of the debtor (for transactions in
securities, this is the economy of the issuer) rather than
that of the counterpart transactor, if different. However,
a resident and a nonresident must engage in a transac-
tion with one another for the transaction to be included
in the balance of payments.
4.157 Supplementary data on direct investment posi-
tions may be prepared according to ultimate source and
host economy (destination). The OECD Benchmark
Definition of Foreign Direct Investment , fourth edi-
tion, provides further information for the identification
of ultimate source. When direct investment is chan-
neled through intermediate entities, such as holding
companies or SPEs, there may be particular interest in
supplementary data, such as the following:
(a) in original source economies, data on the basis of
the ultimate host economy ;
(b) in final recipient economies, data on the basis
of the ultimate investing economy or ultimate
controlling parent ; and
(c) in intermediate economies, data with pass-
through funds excluded (see paragraph 6.33).
In the case of round tripping, as discussed in paragraph
6.46, the ultimate investing economy and ultimate host
economy are the same.
g. Stripped securities
4.158 Stripped securities (or strips) may be treated as
the liability of the original issuer if there is no new secu-
rity, or of the party creating the stripped securities if a new
security is created (as discussed in paragraph 5.50).
Chapter 4 g Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence
h. Securities repurchase agreements

4.159 The treatment of securities under reverse trans-
actions, such as repurchase agreements, is discussed in
paragraphs 5.52–5.54. Under that treatment, securities
under reverse transactions are regarded as still being
owned by the security-providing party, because there is
no change of economic ownership.

i. Nominee accounts and custodians

4.160 Nominees are a legal device for holding assets
for confidentiality or convenience reasons. The assets
held in nominee accounts should be attributed to the
beneficial owner, not the nominee. However, for issu-
ers of securities, it may be difficult to identify whether
nominees hold assets in their own right or as nominees.
Furthermore, if the assets are held by a nominee, it is
recognized that it may be difficult to identify the ben-
eficial owner.

j. Depository receipts

4.161 Depository receipts are securities that repre-
sent ownership of securities held by a depository (see
paragraph 5.23 for further information). The economy
of issue of the underlying securities is different from the
economy in which the depository receipts are issued.
Depository receipts allow investors to acquire an inter-
est in companies in other economies, while still using
the payment and settlement systems and registration
procedures of another economy. Depository receipts are
treated as being a claim on the issuer of the underlying
security, not that of the issuer of the depository receipt.

k. Gold bullion included in monetary gold

4.162 Gold bullion that has no counterpart liability
is shown as unallocated in position data on assets by
counterpart. For partner data on transactions, if a con-
vention based on issuer is adopted, the transaction can be
assigned to an unallocated or residual partner economy.

l. Special drawing rights

4.163 These instruments are discussed in paragraphs
5.34–5.35. SDRs are based on a cooperative arrange-
ment among the members of the SDR Department and
other participants. The membership (SDR Department
participants) incurs the asset and liability positions unto
itself. Given that claims on and liabilities to members in
the SDR system are attributed on a cooperative basis, an
unallocated or residual partner category is used as the
counterparty to SDR holdings and SDR allocations.

m. Quasi-corporations
4.164 When an actual entity is split into separate
institutional units (such as for joint administration
zones, branches, notional resident units, and multiterri-
tory enterprises, as noted in paragraphs 4.10 and 4.26–
4.44), they should be split consistently in partner data
for statistics in the economy of the counterparties.
3. Changes in residence of institutional units
a. Change in residence of individuals
4.165 Households or their individual members can
change their territory of residence. Because all mem-
bers of a household are residents of the same territory,
the movement of an individual may require that the
person leave one household and become a member
of another household. The change in the residence by
an owner of an asset or by someone who has a liabil-
ity requires a reclassification, because no exchange
is made between two parties and, accordingly, no
transaction occurs. (The entries are discussed in para-
graphs 9.21–9.22.)

b. Assets moved between entities
4.166 For what are called “corporate migrations,”
two situations can occur: one in which assets are moved
between entities and another in which the corporation
itself changes residence. When a company is said to
relocate to another jurisdiction, it usually involves
transactions to move assets from a corporation in one
economy to a related corporation in a different economy
(see paragraphs 8.19–8.22, “corporate inversion and
other restructuring”). That is, the ownership of assets is
moved, rather than the entity changing residence.
c. Change in residence of entities other than
persons
4.167 In contrast, in some rare cases, an entity
changes its residence (i.e., without moving assets to
ownership by another entity). These cases could arise
from exchanges of territory between governments.
Additionally, corporation or trust law in some cases
allows entity emigration or immigration (e.g., it could
be permitted within an economic union, but is not gen-
erally the case for most jurisdictions). The effects on
the IIP would be treated as other changes in volume in
the same way as for the change in residence of an indi-
vidual, recorded in the other changes in financial assets
and liabilities account. (These cases are discussed in
paragraph 9.23.)
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

4. Alternatives to the residence concept

4.168 With globalization, an increasing number of
entities have connections to two or more economies.
Some additional data sets provide alternatives to the
residence concept, such as those based on ownership
(as in data on the activities of multinational enterprises,
as discussed in Appendix 4, and consolidated bank-

ing statistics) and provide additional information, such
as on resident workers who send remittances abroad
(as discussed in Appendix 5). In consolidated banking
statistics, banking groups and their global operations
are reported as a single entity (i.e., all the controlled
affiliates of an enterprise are allocated to the economy
of the head office).

Chapter 5. Classifications of Financial Assets and Liabilities
5.1 This chapter discusses the classifications of
financial assets and liabilities used in the international
accounts. These classifications are applied to positions,
the associated income and financial account transac-
tions, and other changes involving financial assets and
liabilities. Classifications are used to group similar
components and to separate components with different
characteristics. The international accounts functional
categories and their relationship to the instruments
classification are discussed in Chapter 6.

1. Economic assets in general

5.2 Economic assets are resources over which own-
ership rights are enforced and from which future eco-
nomic benefits may flow to the owner. They include fixed
assets, such as equipment and research and development,
that are used repeatedly or continuously in production
over more than one year. They also include inventories,
valuables, nonproduced assets, and financial assets.

5.3 Every economic asset has an owner. The eco-
nomic owner of the asset is the party who has the risks

and rewards of ownership. Rewards of ownership usu-
ally include the right to use, rent out, or otherwise gen-
erate income, or to sell the asset. The risks include the
potential losses caused by damage, theft, and holding
losses; that management, transfer, or maintenance costs
are greater than anticipated; and, in the case of financial
assets, default of the counterparty. Ownership may be
subject to costs such as maintenance and taxes. Usu-
ally, the economic owner is the same as the legal owner,
but they may differ in cases such as financial leases.
Under some legal arrangements, elements of the risks
and rewards are split between different parties, so it is
necessary to identify which party has the bulk of risks
and rewards to identify the economic ownership. Every
economic asset has demonstrable value, functioning as a
store of value that reflects the amounts of the economic
benefits that its owner can derive by holding it, using it,
or providing it temporarily to another entity. It may be
tangible or intangible. Different kinds of economic ben-
efits that may be derived from an asset include:
(a) the ability to use assets, such as buildings or
machinery, in production;
(b) the generation of services, for example, renting
out produced assets to another entity;
(c) the generation of property income (e.g., interest
and dividends received by the owners of finan-
cial assets); and
(d) the potential to sell and thus realize holding
gains.
In the special case of a short position, a negative asset
is identified, as discussed in paragraph 7.28.
5.4 The classification system of economic assets
recognized in macroeconomic data sets is shown in
Table 5.1. In the international accounts, produced assets
are covered in the goods and services account, nonpro-
duced nonfinancial assets in the capital account, and
financial assets and liabilities in the financial account
and IIP. This chapter deals with the classification of
financial assets and liabilities.

2. Financial instruments

5.5 Financial instruments consist of the full range
of financial contracts made between institutional units.
Financial instruments may give rise to financial claims
(as discussed in paragraph 5.6) or not (as discussed in
paragraphs 5.10–5.13).

3. Claims

5.6 A claim is a financial instrument that gives
rise to an economic asset that has a counterpart
liability. Claims arise from contractual relationships
entered into when one institutional unit promises to
provide funds or other resources to another in the
future. (Usually, funds or resources are supplied at
the beginning of the relationship, but not in the case
of futures contracts.) The only financial instrument
that does not give rise to a claim is gold bullion that
is included in monetary gold. (The term claim is used
in a different sense in the context of insurance; see
paragraph 5.64(b).)

5.7 Each claim is a financial asset that has a cor-
responding liability. The existence of two parties to a
claim means that it can arise in a cross-border situation.

Equity is regarded as a claim as it represents a claim of
the owner on the residual value of the entity.
5.8 Nonfinancial assets do not have a corresponding
liability. For example, emission rights and commodities
may be traded on organized markets similar to those of
traded financial assets, but do not have a corresponding
liability. In contrast, a financial derivative relating to a
commodity price does have a counterpart liability and
is a financial asset.
4. Financial assets
5.9 Financial assets consist of claims and the gold
bullion component of monetary gold. Financial assets
consist of equity and investment fund shares, debt
instruments, financial derivatives and employee stock
options, and monetary gold. Financial assets can be
delineated from financial instruments in that:
(a) some instruments do not give rise to financial
assets, as discussed in paragraphs 5.10–5.14.
Examples of instruments not recognized as
assets are one-off guarantees not yet activated
and unrealized commitments such as lines of
credit, loan commitments, and letters of credit;
and
(b) when held as monetary gold, gold bullion is a
financial asset that is not created by an instru-

ment and that does not represent a claim on
another entity. It is considered to be a financial
asset because of its role as a means of interna-
tional payments and store of value for use in
reserve assets. (The unallocated gold account
component of monetary gold does have a coun-
terpart claim; it is discussed in paragraph 5.74.)
5. Other financial instruments not recognized
as financial assets

5.10 Contingent assets and liabilities are contrac-
tual financial arrangements between institutional units
that do not give rise to unconditional requirements
either to make payments or to provide other objects
of value. They are not recognized as financial assets
or liabilities prior to the condition(s) being fulfilled.
However, by conferring certain rights or obligations
that may affect future decisions, they can produce an
economic impact on the parties involved. As a result,
supplementary information may be provided on sig-
nificant contingent assets or liabilities. A contingent
claim sold to another party is classified under contracts,
leases, and licenses; is not included in the IIP; and has
no counterpart liability.

5.11 Although the value of future payments arising
from equity, financial derivatives, index-linked instru-
ments, insurance reserves, and provisions for standard-
ized guarantees is uncertain, they are recognized as
financial assets rather than as contingent assets. In
these cases, the liability exists, but the amounts pay-
able depend on subsequent events.

5.12 One-off guarantees of payment by third parties
are contingent because payment is required only if the
principal debtor defaults. However, provisions for calls
under standardized guarantees are not considered to be
contingent because of the more predictable expectation
of payment under standardized guarantees. (Defini-
tions of standardized and one-off guarantees are given
in paragraph 5.68.)

5.13 Lines of credit, letters of credit, and loan com-
mitments assure that funds will be made available, but
no financial asset (i.e., loan) is created until funds are
actually advanced. Letters of credit are promises to
make payment only when certain documents speci-
fied by contract are presented. Note issuance facilities
assure that parties will be able to sell short-term securi-
ties that they issue and that the financial corporations
providing the facility will purchase any notes not sold
in the market. Only if the financial corporation provid-
ing the facility makes funds available will it acquire

an actual asset, to be recorded in its balance sheet.
Uncalled share capital is contingent unless there is an
obligation to pay the amount.
5.14 Sums set aside in business accounting to pro-
vide for future liabilities or for future expenditures are
not recognized as liabilities. Only actual current liabili-
ties to another party or parties are explicitly included
in financial assets and liabilities. When the anticipated
liability becomes actual, it is recognized. A future
stream of revenue, such as future tax collections or roy-
alties receipts, is not recognized as a financial asset.
6. Other issues
5.15 Securities are debt and equity instruments that
have the characteristic feature of negotiability. That
is, their legal ownership is readily capable of being
transferred from one unit to another unit by delivery
or endorsement. While any financial instrument can
potentially be traded, securities are designed to be
traded, usually on organized exchanges or “over the
counter.” (The over-the-counter market involves par-
ties negotiating directly with one another, rather than
on a public exchange.) Negotiability is a matter of the
legal form of the instrument. Some securities may be
legally negotiable, but there is not, in fact, a liquid
market where they can be readily bought or sold. Listed
financial derivatives, such as warrants, are sometimes
considered to be securities.
5.16 A discussion of Islamic banking instruments
and how they can be treated in terms of the classifica-
tion of financial assets and liabilities can be found in
Appendix 2 of MFSM 2000.

B. Classification of Financial Assets and Liabilities by Type of Instrument
1. Introduction to classification of particular
financial assets and liabilities
5.17 This Manual uses three broad categories of
financial assets and liabilities: (1) equity and investment
fund shares, (2) debt instruments, and (3) other financial
assets and liabilities. The 2008 SNA and this Manual use
an additional, more detailed classification of financial
assets and liabilities. The classification is based primar-
ily on the legal characteristics that describe the form of
the underlying relationship between the parties to an
instrument, which are also related to their liquidity and
economic purpose. Although financial innovation leads
to the emergence of new types of instruments, the clas-

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

sification is intended to provide broad categories that
allow for international comparability and the inclusion of
new instruments within the existing categories.

5.18 Table 5.2 shows the SNA instruments classi-
fication and the corresponding type of income they
generate. The linking of income with the correspond-
ing assets and liabilities facilitates calculation of rates
of return, which are useful for both analysis and data
verification. Table 5.3 shows the 2008 SNA classifica-
tion and the corresponding broad categories.

2. Equity and investment fund shares

5.19 Equity and investment fund shares have the
distinguishing feature that the holders own a residual
claim on the assets of the institutional unit that issued
the instrument. Equity represents the owners’ funds in
the institutional unit. In contrast to debt, equity does
not generally provide the owner with a right to a prede-
termined amount or an amount determined according
to a fixed formula.

5.20 Investment fund shares have a specialized
role in financial intermediation as a kind of collective
investment in other assets, so they are identified sepa-
rately. Additionally, the treatment of portfolio invest-
ment income differs, in that reinvested earnings are
imputed for investment fund shares (as shown in para-
g r aphs 11.37–11.39).
a. Equity
5.21 Equity consists of all instruments and records
that acknowledge claims on the residual value of a corpo-
ration or quasi-corporation, after the claims of all credi-
tors have been met. Equity is treated as a liability of the
issuing institutional unit (a corporation or other unit).
5.22 Ownership of equity in legal entities is usually
evidenced by shares, stocks, participations, depository
receipts, or similar documents. Shares and stocks have
the same meaning. Participating preferred shares are
those that provide for participation in the residual value
on the dissolution of an incorporated enterprise. Such

(^2) By convention, lending fees on equity securities, gold loans, and gold swaps are classified as interest (see paragraph 11.67).

located gold accounts is in deposits.

shares are also equity securities, whether or not the
income is fixed or determined according to a formula.
(For nonparticipating preferred shares, see paragraph
5.46.) In addition to the purchase of shares, the value
of equity can be affected by a range of factors, such as
share premiums, accumulated reinvested or retained
earnings, or revaluations. In addition, a direct inves-
tor may increase its equity in an affiliate by providing
goods and services (see paragraph 8.17) or assuming
debt (see paragraph 8.45(c)).

5.23 Depository receipts are securities that repre-
sent ownership of securities listed in other economies.

Depository receipts listed on one exchange represent
ownership of securities listed on another exchange, and
ownership of the depository receipts is treated as if it
represents direct ownership of the underlying securi-
ties. Depository receipts facilitate transactions in secu-
rities in economies other than their home listing. The
underlying securities may be equity or debt securities.
5.24 Equity may be split on a supplementary basis
into:
(a) listed shares,
(b) unlisted shares, and
(c) other equity.

Both listed and unlisted shares are equity securities
(securities are defined in paragraph 5.15). Listed shares
are those listed on an exchange and may sometimes be
referred to as quoted shares. Unlisted shares may some-
times be referred to as private equity^1 (venture capital
often takes this form).

5.25 The existence of quoted prices of shares listed
on an exchange means that current market prices are
usually readily available. In addition to the valuation
aspects, listed and unlisted shares tend to be issued
by different types of corporations (subsidiaries and
smaller businesses) and typically have different regula-
tory requirements.

5.26 Other equity is equity that is not in the form of
securities. It can include equity in quasi-corporations,
such as branches, trusts, limited liability and other part-
nerships, unincorporated funds, and notional units for
ownership of real estate and other natural resources. The
ownership of many international organizations is not in
the form of shares and so is classified as other equity
(although equity in the BIS is in the form of unlisted
shares). Ownership of currency union central banks is
included in other equity (see paragraph A3.44).

5.27 The general principles of valuation given in
paragraphs 3.84–3.91 apply to equity. However, because
prices may not be observable for unlisted shares and
other equity positions, other methods are noted in para-
graphs 7.15–7.18.

b. Investment fund shares or units

5.28 Investment funds are collective investment
undertakings through which investors pool funds for
investment in financial or nonfinancial assets or both.
These funds issue shares (if a corporate structure is
used) or units (if a trust structure is used). Investment
funds include money market funds (MMF) and non-
MMF investment funds, discussed further in para-
graphs 4.73–4.74. Investment fund shares or units refer
to the shares issued by mutual funds and unit trusts,
rather than the shares they may hold.

5.29 MMFs are investment funds that invest only
or primarily in short-term money market securities
such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit, and com-
mercial paper. MMF shares and units sometimes are
functionally close to transferable deposits, for example,

(^1) Private equity refers to the source of equity funds being on
private markets; however, private equity may be used to invest in
listed shares, including to take over publicly listed companies, and
delist them.
accounts with unrestricted check-writing privileges. If
MMF shares are included in broad money in the report-
ing economy, they should be recorded as a separate
item to allow reconciliation with monetary statistics.
(See also paragraph 4.73 on MMFs as a subsector.)
5.30 Investment funds invest in a range of assets,
such as debt securities, equity, commodity-linked
investments, real estate, shares in other investment
funds, and structured assets. Data on the composition
of their assets could be useful in economies in which
investment funds are significant.

3. Debt instruments
Reference:
IMF and others, External Debt Statistics: Guide for
Compilers and Users , paragraphs 2.3–2.11.
5.31 Debt instruments are those instruments that
require the payment of principal and/or interest at
some point(s) in the future.^2 Debt instruments con-
sist of SDRs, currency and deposits, debt securities,
loans, insurance technical reserves, pension and related
entitlements, provision for calls under standardized
guarantees, and other accounts receivable/payable. The
term debt instrument is applicable to both the liability
and the corresponding claim. Some instruments, such
as currency and some deposits, pay no interest. With
insurance and pension schemes, the income flow is
called investment income attributable to policyholders,
rather than interest.
5.32 Debt instruments can be contrasted with equity
and investment shares in the nature of the liability
and risk. Whereas equity gives a residual claim on
the assets of the entity, a debt instrument involves an
obligation to pay an amount of principal and/or inter-
est usually according to a predefined formula, which
usually means that the creditor has a more limited risk
exposure. Provided that the debtor is solvent, debt obli-
gations are largely fixed or linked by a formula to some
other variable, such as a market interest rate or the price
of a selected item. In contrast, the return on equity is
largely dependent on the economic performance of the
issuer. Because of the different nature of risk, debt is an
important grouping for analysis. Financial derivatives,

(^2) Interest payments are periodic payments of interest costs. All
other payments on debt instruments are principal payments. Further
information is available in External Debt Statistics: Guide for Com-
pilers and Users , Chapter 2, The Measurement of External Debt:
Definition and Core Accounting Principles, and Appendix III, Glos-
sary of External Debt Terms.
Chapter 5 g Classifications of Financial Assets and Liabilities

both forwards and options, are distinguished from debt
instruments because no principal amount is advanced
that is required to be repaid, and no interest accrues
on any financial derivative instrument. That is, unlike
financial derivatives, debt instruments have a principal
amount, usually associated with the supply of financial
or other resources.

5.33 Because debt instruments involve an obligation
to repay principal, short- or long-term classification
(according to either original or remaining maturity)
is of analytical significance. The maturity splits are
explained in paragraphs 5.103–5.105.

a. Special drawing rights

5.34 SDRs are international reserve assets created
by the IMF and allocated to members to supplement
existing official reserves. SDRs are held only by the
monetary authorities of IMF members and a limited
number of international financial institutions that are
authorized holders. SDR holdings represent uncondi-
tional rights to obtain foreign exchange or other reserve
assets from other IMF members. (For more informa-
tion, see paragraph 7.83.)

5.35 Holdings of SDRs by an IMF member are
recorded as an asset, while the allocation of SDRs is
recorded as the incurrence of a liability of the member
receiving them (because of a requirement to repay the
allocation in certain circumstances, and also because
interest accrues). The holdings and allocations should
be shown gross, rather than netted.

b. Currency and deposits

Currency
5.36 Currency consists of notes and coins that are
of fixed nominal values and are issued or authorized by
central banks or governments.

5.37 Some countries issue gold coins, which are
held for intrinsic value, or commemorative coins,
which are held for numismatic value. If not in active
circulation, such coins are not classified as financial
assets but as goods (except for gold coins that are clas-
sified as monetary gold; see paragraph 6.78). Simi-
larly, central bank or central government holdings of
unissued or demonetized currency are not financial
assets. (Acquisition of unissued currency by a mon-
etary authority from a printer or coin manufacturer is
included in goods; see paragraph 10.17(a).)

5.38 Foreign currency in circulation, including as
legal tender, is shown as a currency asset of the resident

holder and as a liability of the issuer. Transactions that
take place between residents settled in foreign currency
in circulation are domestic transactions. Currency as
an instrument, as discussed in this section, can be con-
trasted with the classification of all kinds of instruments
as being either domestic currency or foreign currency
(as discussed further in paragraphs 3.98–3.103).
Deposits
5.39 Deposits include all claims that are (a) on
the central bank, deposit-taking corporations other
than the central bank, and, in some cases, other insti-
tutional units; and (b) represented by evidence of
deposit. A deposit is usually a standard contract, open
to the public at large, that allows the placement of a
variable amount of money. The nominal value of depos-
its is usually fixed in terms of the currency in which
the deposits are denominated. In some cases, deposits
may have their value expressed in terms of an index or
linked to a commodity price, for example, gold, oil, or
share prices. Unallocated accounts for precious metals
are also deposits, except for unallocated gold accounts
held by monetary authorities for reserves purposes,
for which the asset holding is included in monetary
gold (with the counterpart liability being recorded as a
deposit—see paragraph 5.77).
5.40 Deposits are distinguished from loans on the
basis of the representation in the documents that evidence
them. There may be cases in which the distinction is
unclear, because the parties are uncertain or take differ-
ent views. When one party is a deposit-taking corporation
and the other is not, a possible convention is that an asset
position of a deposit-taking corporation is classified as
a loan by both parties. Similarly, a liability of a deposit-
taking corporation to another type of entity is classified
as a deposit by both parties. Classification of interbank
positions as deposits is discussed in paragraph 5.42.
Transferable deposits
5.41 Transferable deposits consist of all deposits
that are (a) exchangeable for banknotes and coins on
demand at par and without penalty or restriction and
(b) directly usable for making payments by check, draft,
giro order, direct debit or credit, or other direct pay-
ment facility. Some types of deposit accounts embody
only limited features of transferability. For example,
some deposits have restrictions such as on the number
of third-party payments that can be made per period or
on the minimum size of the individual third-party pay-
ments. An overdraft arising from the overdraft facility
of a transferable deposit account is classified as a loan.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Interbank positions
5.42 Interbank positions can be shown as a separate
component of deposits. In some cases, the instrument
classification of interbank positions may be unclear, for
example, because the parties are uncertain or one party
considers it as a loan and the other a deposit. There-
fore, as a convention to ensure symmetry, all interbank
positions other than securities and accounts receivable/
payable are classified under deposits.

Other deposits
5.43 Other deposits consist of all claims, other
than transferable deposits, that are represented by
evidence of deposit. Other deposits include savings
and fixed-term deposits, and nonnegotiable certifi-
cates of deposit. (Negotiable certificates are classi-
fied as debt securities.) Restricted deposits, defined as
those for which withdrawals are restricted on the basis
of legal, regulatory, or commercial requirements, are
included in other deposits, as well as shares or simi-
lar evidence of deposit issued by savings and loan
associations, building societies, credit unions, and
the like. Liabilities under securities repurchase agree-
ments that are included in national measures of broad
money are also other deposits (while liabilities under
other repurchase agreements are included in loans).
Reserve position in the IMF (see paragraph 6.85) is
included in other deposits.

c. Debt securities

5.44 Debt securities are negotiable instruments
serving as evidence of a debt. They include bills,
bonds, notes, negotiable certificates of deposit, com-
mercial paper, debentures, asset-backed securities,
money market instruments, and similar instruments
normally traded in the financial markets. Bills are
defined as securities that give the holders the uncon-
ditional rights to receive stated fixed sums on a speci-
fied date. Bills are generally issued at discounts to
face value that depend on the rate of interest and the
time to maturity and are usually traded in organized
markets. Examples of short-term securities are trea-
sury bills, negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’
acceptances, promissory notes, and commercial paper.
Debt securities give the holders the unconditional
right to fixed or contractually determined variable
payments (i.e., earning of interest is not dependent on
earnings of the debtors. Depository receipts whose
underlying securities are debt securities are debt secu-
rities (see paragraph 5.23).

Possible reclassification of traded loans as securities
5.45 Loans that have become negotiable from one
holder to another are to be reclassified from loans to
debt securities under certain circumstances. For such
reclassification, there needs to be evidence of second-
ary market trading, including the existence of market
makers, and frequent quotations of the instrument, such
as provided by bid-offer spreads.
Nonparticipating preferred stocks and
convertible bonds
5.46 Nonparticipating preferred stocks or shares are
those that pay a fixed income but do not provide for
participation in the distribution of the residual value of
an incorporated enterprise on dissolution. These shares
are classified as debt securities. (See also paragraph 5.22
concerning participating preferred shares.) Bonds that
are convertible into equity should be classified as debt
securities prior to the time that they are converted.
Asset-backed securities
5.47 Asset-backed securities, collateralized debt
obligations, and collateralized mortgage obligations
are arrangements under which payments of interest
and principal are backed by payments on specified
assets or income streams. They are backed by mort-
gages, home equity loans, student loans, and other
debts as well as pools of leased property. Securi-
tization of these assets provides liquidity in assets
that are otherwise not so liquid.^3 Asset-backed secu-
rities may be issued by a specific holding unit or
vehicle, which issues securities that are sold to raise
funds to pay the originator for the underlying assets.
Asset-backed securities are classified as debt securi-
ties because the security issuers have a requirement
to make payments, while the holders do not have
a residual claim on the underlying assets; if they
did, the instrument would be equity or investment
funds shares. Asset-backed securities are backed by
various types of financial assets (e.g., mortgages
and credit card loans), nonfinancial assets, or future
income streams—such as the earnings of a musi-
cian or a government’s future revenue—that are not
recognized as economic assets in macroeconomic
statistics.
(^3) Another term used is “structured finance.” This refers to the
repackaging of existing financial assets—securities, loans, or other
assets—into new instruments that are structured to meet the liquid-
ity, creditworthiness, and return preferences of particular investors.
These arrangements may incorporate financial derivatives.
Chapter 5 g Classifications of Financial Assets and Liabilities

Bankers’ acceptances
5.48 Bankers’ acceptances involve the acceptance
by a financial corporation, in return for a fee, of a
draft or bill of exchange and the unconditional prom-
ise to pay a specific amount at a specified date. Much
international trade is financed this way. Bankers’
acceptances are classified under the category of debt
securities. Bankers’ acceptances represent uncondi-
tional claims on the part of the holder and an uncon-
ditional liability on the part of the accepting financial
corporation; the financial corporation’s counterpart
asset is a claim on its customer. Bankers’ acceptances
are treated as financial assets from the time of accep-
tance, even though funds may not be exchanged until
a later stage.

Index-linked securities
5.49 Index-linked securities are those for which the
principal or coupons or both are linked to another
item, such as a price index or the price of a com-
modity. These securities are classified as variable-rate
instruments (see paragraph 5.113). Issues for the mea-
surement of revaluations and interest are discussed in
paragraphs 9.34 and 11.59–11.65, respectively.

Stripped securities
5.50 Stripped securities are securities that have
been transformed from a principal amount with cou-
pon payments into a series of zero-coupon bonds,
with a range of maturities matching the coupon pay-
ment date(s) and the redemption date of the prin-
cipal amount(s). They are also called strips. The
function of stripping is that investor preferences for
particular cash flows can be met in ways that are
different from the mix of cash flows of the original
security. Stripped securities may have a different
issuer from the original issuer—in which case new
liabilities are created. Following are the two cases of
stripped securities:

When a third party acquires the original securities
and uses them to back the issue of the stripped
securities. Then new funds have been raised and a
new financial instrument is created.
When no new funds are raised and the payments on
the original securities are stripped and separately
marketed by the issuer or through agents (such as
strip dealers) acting with the issuer’s consent.
(Paragraph 11.58 discusses how interest on stripped
securities is calculated on an accrual basis.)

d. Loans
5.51 Loans are financial assets that (a) are created
when a creditor lends funds directly to a debtor, and
(b) are evidenced by documents that are not negotiable.^4
This category includes all loans, including those under
overdraft facilities, except accounts receivable/payable,
which are treated as a separate category of financial
assets. Loans that have become debt securities (as
noted in paragraph 5.45) are also excluded from loans.
This category includes installment loans, hire-purchase
credit, and loans to finance trade credit. Claims on
or liabilities to the IMF (including use of IMF credit)
that are in the form of loans are also included in this
category (see also paragraph 6.85 on the treatment of
loans provided to the IMF General Resources Account;
and Annex 7.1 on loans and credit from the IMF). An
overdraft arising from the overdraft facility of a trans-
ferable deposit account is classified as a loan. However,
undrawn lines of credit are not recognized as a liability.
The distinction between loans and deposits is discussed
under deposits in paragraph 5.40.
Securities repurchase agreements and gold swaps
Reference:
BIS, Securities Lending Transactions: Market Devel-
opment and Implications , CPSS Publications No.
32, July 1999.
5.52 A securities repurchase agreement is an
arrangement involving the provision of securities in
exchange for cash with a commitment to repurchase the
same or similar securities at a fixed price. The commit-
ment to repurchase may be either on a specified future
date (often one or a few days hence, but also further
in the future) or an “open” maturity. Repos, securities
lending with cash collateral, and sale-buybacks are dif-
ferent terms for arrangements with the same economic
effect as a securities repurchase agreement—all involve
the provision of securities as collateral for a loan or
deposit. A repo is used as a term from the perspective
of the security provider, while a reverse repo is used
from the perspective of the security taker. Securities
repurchase agreements are a subset of reverse transac-
tions (as discussed in paragraphs 7.58–7.61).
5.53 The supply and receipt of funds under a securi-
ties repurchase agreement is treated as a loan or deposit.
It is generally a loan, but it is classified as a deposit if it
(^4) Negotiability is defined in paragraph 5.15. Loans may be traded,
but their legal form is not designed for negotiability in the same way
as debt securities.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

involves liabilities of a deposit-taking corporation and
is included in national measures of broad money. If a
securities repurchase agreement does not involve the
supply of cash (i.e., there is an exchange of one security
for another, or one party supplies a security without
collateral), there is no loan or deposit. Margin calls in
cash under a repo are also classified as loans.

5.54 The securities provided as collateral under
securities lending, including a securities repurchase
agreement, are treated as not having changed economic
ownership, as discussed in paragraph 7.58. This treat-
ment is adopted because the cash receiver is still subject
to the risks or rewards of any change in the price of the
security. (The same treatment is adopted for repurchase
agreements without cash collateral, in which case there
is no transaction in the securities and no loan.)

5.55 A gold swap involves an exchange of gold for
foreign exchange deposits with an agreement that the
transaction be reversed at an agreed future date at an
agreed gold price. The gold taker (cash provider) usu-
ally will not record the gold on its balance sheet, while
the gold provider (cash taker) usually will not remove
the gold from its balance sheet. In this manner, the
transaction is analogous to a repurchase agreement and
should be recorded as a collateralized loan or deposit.
Gold swaps are similar to securities repurchase agree-
ments except that the collateral is gold.^5

Financial leases
References:

2008 SNA , Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues, Part 5, Contracts, leases and licences.

International Accounting Standards Board, Interna-
tional Financial Reporting Standards , Interna-
tional Accounting Standard 17, Leases.
5.56 A financial lease is a contract under which
the lessor as legal owner of an asset conveys substan-
tially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
asset to the lessee. In other words, the lessee becomes
the economic owner of the asset. Under a financial
lease, the lessor is shown as making a loan to the lessee
with which the lessee acquires the asset. Thereafter the
leased asset is shown on the balance sheet of the lessee
and not of the lessor; the corresponding loan is shown
as an asset of the lessor and a liability of the lessee.

(^5) Gold swaps should not be confused with a swap giving rise to a
financial derivative. The two types of arrangements have different
risk transfer implications; under a gold swap, the economic owner-
ship of the gold does not change hands (see paragraph 5.91).
5.57 Examples of situations that would normally
lead to a lease being classified as a financial lease
include that:
(a) the lease transfers legal ownership to the lessee
at the end of the lease term; or
(b) the lease has the option for the lessee to acquire
legal ownership at the end of the lease term at a
price that is sufficiently low that the exercise of
the option is reasonably certain; or
(c) the lease term is for the major part of the eco-
nomic life of the asset; or
(d) at inception, the present value of the lease pay-
ments amount to substantially all of the value of
the asset; or
(e) if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor’s
losses are borne by the lessee; or
(f) gains or losses in the residual value of the resid-
ual asset accrue to the lessee; or
(g) the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for
a secondary period for a payment substantially
lower than market value.
These examples may not be conclusive that substan-
tially all of the risks have been conveyed; for example,
if the asset is conveyed to the lessee at the end of the
lease at its fair value at that time, then the lessor holds
substantial risks of ownership. Financial leases are
also called finance leases or capital leases, highlight-
ing that the motivation is to finance acquisition of
the asset. Accounting practices generally recognize
financial leases in the same manner as this definition.
In addition to financial leases recognized in busi-
ness accounts, a treatment akin to financial leases
is adopted for some public-private partnerships^6 (see
2008 SNA , Chapter 22, The General Government and
Public Sectors).
5.58 The treatment of financial leases is designed
to move away from the legal arrangements to capture
the economic reality of such arrangements, by treating
assets under a financial lease as if they were purchased
and owned by the user. For example, if a bank leases
an aircraft to an aviation company, at the time the com-
pany is deemed to take economic ownership of the
aircraft, it is shown as an asset in the balance sheet of
(^6) For example, a build, own, operate, transfer scheme could be
found to assign the risks and rewards of ownership to the govern-
ment, so the private partner would be treated as a provider of a
financial lease.
Chapter 5 g Classifications of Financial Assets and Liabilities

the aviation company, while the loan is recorded as a
liability. That is, the IIP will show a loan between the
aviation company and the bank.

5.59 The debt liability at the inception of the lease
is defined as the value of the asset and is financed
by a loan of the same value, a liability of the lessee.
The loan is repaid through payments during the con-
tract (which consist of interest, principal, and, if a
financial intermediary is involved, FISIM (financial
intermediation services indirectly measured) ele-
ments) and any residual payment at the end of the
contract (or alternatively, by the return of the good
to the lessor). Appendix 6b provides references to
where financial leases are discussed in various parts
of this Manual.

5.60 Financial leases may be distinguished from
other kinds of leases identified in macroeconomic sta-
tistics because substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred from the legal owner of the
good (the lessor) to the user of the good (the lessee).
Other kinds of leases are as follows:

(a) Operating leases. An operating lease is one in
which the legal owner of a produced asset is also
the economic owner and has the operating risks
and rewards from ownership of the asset. One
indicator of an operating lease is that it is the
responsibility of the legal owner to provide any
necessary repair and maintenance of the asset.
Under an operating lease, the asset remains on
the balance sheet of the lessor. Operating leases
give rise to services, as discussed in more detail
in paragraphs 10.153–10.157.
(b) Resource leases. A resource lease is an agree-
ment whereby the legal owner of a natural
resource that has an infinite life makes it avail-
able to a lessee in return for a regular payment,
which is recorded as rent. The resource contin-
ues to be recorded on the balance sheet of the
lessor even though it is used by the lessee. Other
arrangements involving natural resources may
amount to an outright sale of a natural resource
to the lessee (such as spectrum licenses for a
long period; see paragraph 13.9). Some leases
of natural resources, such as mining licenses
held by nonresidents lead to the imputation of
a notional resident unit (see paragraphs 4.34–
4.40), so that the lease is between residents, and
the international transactions associated with the
lease are recorded as being for direct investment
equity in the notional unit.
(c) Contracts, leases, and licenses. A transferable
lease other than a financial lease that meets the
definition of an economic asset is shown in the
capital account as a nonproduced nonfinancial
asset, as discussed in paragraphs 13.11–13.15.
Financial or finite risk reinsurance
5.61 Financial or finite risk reinsurance is defined
as a kind of insurance policy that involves no or very
limited transfer of risk. Depending on how much risk is
transferred, it could be classified as a loan or an insur-
ance policy. For example, an insurance company may
have a finite risk reinsurance policy that allows it to
borrow funds in the event of incurring large values of
claims. Because those amounts are repayable, however,
the policy has a financing function and amounts drawn
under the policy are classified as a loan. In contrast, if
the amounts under the policy are not repayable, then
risk is transferred to the reinsurer, so it has a risk pool-
ing function and is a part of insurance.
e. Insurance, pension, and standardized
guarantee schemes
5.62 Insurance, pension, and standardized guaran-
tee schemes consist of the following:
(a) nonlife insurance technical reserves;
(b) life insurance and annuity entitlements;
(c) pension entitlements, claims of pension funds on
pension managers, and entitlements to nonpen-
sion funds; and
(d) provisions for calls under standardized
guarantees.
5.63 These reserves, entitlements, and provisions
represent liabilities of the insurer, pension fund, or
issuer of standardized guarantees, and a corresponding
asset of the policyholders or beneficiaries. The aggre-
gate values of liabilities can be estimated actuarially
because the company or fund has a pool of liabilities,
but the value is less clear for the asset holders. The
insurers, pension funds, and guarantors usually hold a
range of assets to allow them to meet their obligations;
however, these are not necessarily equal to the provi-
sion and entitlement liabilities.
Nonlife insurance technical reserves
5.64 Nonlife insurance technical reserves consist of
the following:
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

(a) Reserves for unearned insurance premiums,
which are prepayment of premiums. Premiums
are usually paid at the beginning of the period
covered by the policy. On an accrual basis, the
premiums are earned through the policy period,
so that the initial payment involves a prepayment
or advance. It also includes reserves for unex-
pired risks.
(b) Reserves against outstanding insurance claims,
which are amounts identified by insurance
corporations to cover what they expect to pay
out arising from events that have occurred
but for which the claims are not yet settled.
Other reserves, such as equalization reserves,
may be identified by insurers. However, these
are recognized as liabilities and correspond-
ing assets only when there is an event that
gives rise to a liability. Otherwise, equaliza-
tion reserves are internal accounting entries
by the insurer that represent saving to cover
irregularly occurring catastrophes, and thus
do not represent any existing corresponding
claims for policyholders.
Both nonlife direct insurance and reinsurance are
included in this item. Insurance and its terminology are
explained in more detail in Appendix 6c.

Life insurance and annuity entitlements
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues, Part 1, The treatment of insurance.
5.65 This category consists of reserves of life insur-
ance companies and annuity providers for prepaid
premiums and accrued liabilities to life insurance poli-
cyholders and beneficiaries of annuities. Life insurance
and annuity entitlements are used to provide benefits to
policyholders upon the expiry of the policy, or to com-
pensate beneficiaries upon the death of policyholders,
and thus are kept separate from shareholders’ funds.
These entitlements are regarded as liabilities of the
insurance companies and assets of the policyholders and
beneficiaries. Annuities entitlements are the actuarial
calculation of the present value of the obligations to pay
future income until the death of the beneficiaries.

Pension entitlements
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues, Part 2, Social insurance schemes.

5.66 Pension entitlements show the extent of finan-
cial claims both existing and future pensioners hold
against either their employer or a fund designated by the
employer to pay pensions earned as part of a compen-
sation agreement between the employer and employee.
The economy of residence of pension schemes may
differ from that of some of their beneficiaries, in par-
ticular, for border workers, guest workers who return
home, people who retire to a different economy, staff of
international organizations, and employees of transna-
tional enterprise groups that have a single pension fund
for the whole group. In addition to liabilities of pen-
sion funds, liabilities of unfunded pension schemes are
included in this category. There are assumptions and
different methods in the measurement of pension fund
entitlements, so the nature of coverage and estimation
should be stated in metadata. As well as pensions, some
schemes may have other related liabilities, such as for
health benefits, which are included under entitlements
to nonpension benefits. In addition to its pension enti-
tlement liabilities to its beneficiaries, a pension fund
may sometimes have a claim on the employer, other
sponsor, or some other party such as an administrator
of the scheme. On the other hand, the sponsor or some
other party may have a claim on a surplus of the fund.
Such claims are shown under claims of pension funds
on pension managers.
5.67 Potential payments by social security schemes
may not be recognized as financial assets or liabilities.
However, if a social security fund also acts as a pension
scheme (as is sometimes the case for benefits for pres-
ent and former government employees), those pension
obligations are included under this category, but not the
pension fund’s social security obligations.
Provisions for calls under standardized guarantees
Reference:
2008 SNA , Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues, Part 3, The treatment of loan guaran-
tees in the SNA.
5.68 Standardized guarantees are defined as those
that are not provided by means of a financial deriva-
tive (such as credit default swaps), but for which the
probability of default can be well established. These
guarantees cover similar types of credit risk for a large
number of cases. Examples include guarantees issued
by governments on export credit or student loans. Gen-
erally it is not possible to estimate precisely the risk of
any one loan being in default, but it is possible to make
a reliable estimate of how many out of a large number
Chapter 5 g Classifications of Financial Assets and Liabilities
of such loans will default. It is therefore possible for
a guarantor to determine suitable fees to charge for
a guarantee working on the same sort of principle as
an insurance corporation for which the fees received
in respect of many policies cover the losses by a few.
Standardized guarantees can be contrasted with two
other types of guarantees:

(a) Guarantees that are financial derivatives (as
defined in paragraph 5.80). Guarantees that meet
the definition of financial derivatives protect,
on a guarantee-by-guarantee basis, the lender
against certain types of risk arising from a credit
relationship by paying the guarantor a fee for
a specified period. The guarantees covered are
such that experience in the market allows the
guarantor to apply standard master legal agree-
ments or to make a reasonable estimate of the
likelihood of the borrower defaulting and to cal-
culate suitable terms for the financial derivative.
Credit default swaps are included in financial
derivatives as options.
(b) One-off guarantees. One-off guarantees occur
in situations in which the conditions of the loan
or of the security that is guaranteed are so par-
ticular that it is not possible for the degree of
risk associated with it to be calculated with
any degree of precision. These guarantees are
not recognized as economic assets until their
activation, that is, when the event occurs that
makes the guarantor responsible for the liability.
These are contingent assets until activated (see
paragraph 5.12). (See paragraphs 8.42–8.45 on
flows associated with their activation.) However,
one-off guarantees granted by governments to
corporations in financial distress and that have a
very high likelihood of being called are treated
as if they were activated at inception (see para-
graph 13.34).
f. Other accounts receivable/payable

5.69 Other accounts receivable/payable consist of
(a) trade credit and advances and (b) other.

Trade credit and advances
5.70 Trade credit and advances consist of (a) credit
extended directly by the suppliers of goods and services
to their customers^7 and (b) advances for work that is in

(^7) Trade credit is sometimes described as supplier credit or suppli-
er’s credit.
progress (or is yet to be undertaken) and prepayment
by customers for goods and services not yet provided.
5.71 Trade credit and advances arise when payment
for goods or services (other than FISIM and prepay-
ment of insurance services)^8 is not made at the same
time as the change in ownership of a good or provision
of a service. If a payment is made before the change
of ownership, there is an advance. For example, down
payments or holding deposits (where ownership of the
funds changes hands) are included in trade advances.
Changes of ownership for high-value capital goods may
give rise to trade credit and advances, only if there is
a difference in timing between the change of owner-
ship and progress payments (see paragraphs 3.44 and
10.28). If goods or services under barter arrangements
do not change ownership at the same time as the corre-
sponding goods or services, an entry is made for trade
credit and advances.
5.72 Trade credit and advances do not include loans
to finance trade made by an institutional unit other
than the supplier of the good or service, as they are
included under loans.^9 Trade bills drawn on an importer
and provided to an exporter, which are subsequently
discounted by the exporter with a financial institution,
might be regarded by the importer as the direct exten-
sion of credit by the exporter, but once they are dis-
counted they become a claim by a third party on the
importer. In cases in which an instrument is provided to
the exporter with such characteristics that it is a nego-
tiable instrument, it should be classified as a security. A
supplier may also sell trade claims other than trade bills
to a factoring company, in which the claim is reclassi-
fied from trade credit to accounts receivable/payable.
Other accounts receivable/payable—other
5.73 The other category of other accounts receiv-
able/payable includes accounts receivable or payable
other than those included in trade credit and advances
or other instruments. It includes liabilities for taxes,
purchase and sale of securities, securities lending fees,
gold loan fees, wages and salaries, dividends, and social
contributions that have accrued but not yet paid. It also
(^8) FISIM accrued but not yet paid is included with the relevant
debt instrument, like interest (see paragraph 7.41). Prepayment of
insurance premiums is included in insurance technical reserves (see
paragraph 5.64).
(^9) Trade-related credit is identified as a concept in External Debt
Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users , Chapter 6, Further Exter-
nal Debt Accounting Principles. It consists of trade credit as well as
trade bills and credit provided by third parties to finance trade. It
should be compiled as a supplementary item, where significant.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

includes prepayments of those items. Interest accrued
should be recorded with the financial asset or liabil-
ity on which it accrues, not as other accounts receiv-
able/payable. However, for securities lending and gold
loan fees, which are treated as interest by convention
(see paragraphs 11.67–11.68), the corresponding entries
are included under other accounts receivable/payable,
rather than with the instrument to which they relate.

4. Other financial assets and liabilities

a. Monetary gold

5.74 Monetary gold is gold to which the monetary
authorities (or others who are subject to the effective
control of the monetary authorities) have title and is
held as reserve assets. Gold includes gold bullion and
unallocated gold accounts with nonresidents that give
title to claim the delivery of gold. Gold bullion takes
the form of coins, ingots, or bars with a purity of at
least 995 parts per 1,000, including such gold held in
allocated gold accounts.

5.75 All monetary gold is included in reserve assets
or is held by international financial organizations.
Monetary authorities and reserve assets are discussed
further in Chapter 6, Functional Categories, Section F.
Gold bullion included in monetary gold is a financial
asset for which there is no corresponding liability. Gold
bullion not held as reserve assets is not a financial asset
and is included in nonmonetary gold, within the goods
and services account, see paragraphs 10.50–10.54. In
some cases, a central bank may own gold bullion that
is not held as reserves (such as sometimes occurs when
it acts as a monopoly reseller of mined gold).

Gold accounts
Allocated gold accounts
5.76 Allocated gold accounts provide ownership of
a specific piece of gold. The ownership of the gold
remains with the entity placing it for safe custody.
These accounts typically offer the purchasing, storing,
and selling of investment-grade bars and coin to order.
Accounts of this type constitute full outright owner-
ship of the gold. When held as reserve assets, allocated
gold accounts are classified as monetary gold. When
not held as reserve assets, allocated gold accounts are
treated as representing ownership of a good.

Unallocated gold accounts
5.77 In contrast, unallocated gold accounts repre-
sent a claim against the account operator to deliver

gold. For these accounts, the account provider holds
title to a reserve base of physical (allocated) gold
and issues claims to account holders denominated in
gold. When held as reserve assets, unallocated gold
accounts are classified as monetary gold. Unallocated
gold account assets not held as reserve assets, and
all unallocated gold account liabilities, are classi-
fied as deposits. Gold accounts can be distinguished
from accounts that are linked (indexed) to gold but do
not give title to claims for the delivery of gold; such
accounts are not part of monetary gold. They are clas-
sified according to their nature as a financial instru-
ment, usually as deposits.
Relationship to nonmonetary gold
5.78 In contrast to monetary gold, which is a finan-
cial asset, nonmonetary physical gold is a good. (Para-
graphs 10.50–10.54 deal with nonmonetary gold in the
goods and services account.) Similarly, other precious
metals are goods, not financial assets. Monetary gold
is treated differently because of its role as a means of
international payments and store of value for use in
reserve assets. Changes in the classification between
monetary and nonmonetary gold are shown in the other
changes in assets and liabilities account, as discussed in
paragraphs 9.18–9.20.
b. Financial derivatives and employee stock
options
5.79 Financial derivatives and employee stock
options are financial assets and liabilities that have
similar features, such as a strike price and some of the
same risk elements. However, although both transfer
risk, employee stock options are also designed to be a
form of remuneration.
Financial derivatives
5.80 A financial derivative contract is a financial
instrument that is linked to another specific financial
instrument or indicator or commodity and through
which specific financial risks (such as interest rate
risk, foreign exchange risk, equity and commodity
price risks, credit risk, and so on) can be traded in
their own right in financial markets. Transactions and
positions in financial derivatives are treated separately
from the values of any underlying items to which they
are linked.
5.81 The risk embodied in a financial derivative
contract can be traded either by trading the contract
Chapter 5 g Classifications of Financial Assets and Liabilities
itself, as is possible with options, or by creating a new
contract embodying risk characteristics that match, in
a countervailing manner, those of the existing con-
tract. The latter practice, which is termed offsetability,
occurs in forward markets. Offsetability means that it
is often possible to eliminate the risk associated with
a derivative by creating a new but “reverse” contract
having characteristics that countervail the risk under-
lying the first derivative. Buying the new derivative is
the functional equivalent of selling the first derivative
because the result is the elimination of the underlying
financial risk. The ability to countervail the under-
lying risk in the market is therefore considered the
equivalent of tradability in demonstrating value. The
outlay that would be required to replace the existing
derivative contract represents its value; actual offset-
ting is not required.

5.82 In many cases, derivatives contracts are settled
by payments of net amounts in cash, rather than by
the delivery of the underlying items. Once a financial
derivative reaches its settlement date, any unpaid over-
due amount is reclassified as accounts receivable/pay-
able, as its value is fixed, and thus the nature of the
claim becomes debt.

5.83 The following types of financial arrangements
are not financial derivatives:

(a) A fixed-price contract for goods and services
is not a financial derivative unless the contract
is standardized so that the market risk therein
can be traded in financial markets in its own
right. For example, an option to purchase an air-
craft from the manufacturer is not classified as a
financial derivative; if the option to purchase is
transferable, and is in fact transferred, the trans-
action is recorded under contracts, leases, and
licenses, discussed in paragraphs 13.11–13.12.
(b) Insurance and standardized guarantees are not
financial derivatives. Insurance involves the
collection of funds from policyholders to meet
future claims arising from the occurrence of
events specified in insurance policies. That is,
insurance and standardized guarantees are used
to manage event risk primarily by the pooling,
not the trading, of risk. However, some guaran-
tees other than standardized guarantees meet the
definition of financial derivatives (as covered in
paragraph 5.68).
(c) Contingent assets and liabilities, such as one-off
guarantees and letters of credit, are not financial
assets (as discussed in paragraphs 5.10–5.13).
(d) Instruments with embedded derivatives are not
financial derivatives. An embedded derivative
arises when a derivative feature is inserted in a
standard financial instrument and is inseparable
from the instrument. If a primary instrument,
such as a security or loan, contains an embedded
derivative, the instrument is valued and classified
according to its primary characteristics—even
though the value of that security or loan may well
differ from the values of comparable securities
and loans because of the embedded derivative.^10
Examples are bonds that are convertible into
shares, and securities with options for repayment
of principal in currencies that differ from those
in which the securities were issued. However,
detachable warrants are treated as separate finan-
cial derivatives, because they can be detached and
sold in financial markets.
(e) Timing delays that arise in the normal course of
business and may entail exposure to price move-
ments do not give rise to financial derivatives.
Timing delays include normal settlement periods
for spot transactions in financial markets.
5.84 There are two broad types of financial
derivatives—options and forward-type contracts.
Options
5.85 In an option contract (option), the purchaser
acquires from the seller a right to buy or sell (depend-
ing on whether the option is a call (buy) or a put (sell))
a specified underlying item at a strike price on or
before a specified date. The purchaser of an option pays
a premium to the writer of the option. In return, the
buyer acquires the right but not the obligation to buy
(call option) or sell (put option) a specified underlying
item (real or financial) at an agreed-on contract price
(the strike price) on or before a specified date. (On a
derivatives exchange, the exchange itself may act as the
counterparty to each contract.)
5.86 Options can be contrasted with forward-type
contracts in that:
(a) at inception, there is usually no up-front payment
for a forward-type contract and the derivative
contract begins with zero value, whereas there is
(^10) If the owner of the primary instrument subsequently creates
a new but reverse financial derivative contract to offset the risk of
the embedded derivative, the creation of this new financial deriva-
tive contract is recorded as a separate transaction, and it does not
affect the recording of transactions and positions in the primary
instrument.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

usually a premium paid for an option represent-
ing a nonzero value for the contract;
(b) during the life of the contract, for a forward-type
contract, either party can be creditor or debtor,
and it may change, whereas for an option, the
buyer is always the creditor and the writer is
always the debtor; and
(c) at maturity, redemption is unconditional for a
forward-type contract, whereas for an option it is
determined by the buyer of the option.
5.87 Warrants are a form of financial derivative
option giving the owner the right but not the obliga-
tion to purchase from the issuer of the warrant a fixed
amount of an underlying asset, such as equities and
bonds, at an agreed contract price for a specified period
of time or on a specified date. Although similar to
other traded options, a distinguishing factor is that
the exercise of the warrants can create new securities,
thus diluting the capital of existing bond or sharehold-
ers, whereas traded options typically grant rights over
assets that are already available.

Forward-type contracts
5.88 A forward-type contract (forward) is an
unconditional contract by which two counterparties
agree to exchange a specified quantity of an underly-
ing item (real or financial) at an agreed-on contract
price (the strike price) on a specified date. Forward-
type contracts include futures and swaps (other than
as discussed in paragraph 5.91). Forward-type contract
is used as a term because the term “forward” is often
used more narrowly in financial markets (often exclud-
ing swaps).

5.89 Futures are forward-type contracts traded on
organized exchanges. The exchange facilitates trading
by determining the standardized terms and conditions
of the contract, acting as the counterparty to all trades,
and requiring margin to be deposited and paid to miti-
gate against risk. Forward rate agreements and for-
ward foreign exchange contracts are common types of
forward-type contracts.

5.90 At the inception of a forward-type contract,
risk exposures of equal market value are exchanged, so
a contract typically has zero value at that time. As the
price of the underlying item changes, the market value
will change, although it may be restored to zero by
periodic settlement during the life of the forward. The
classification of a forward-type contract may change
between asset and liability positions.

Other issues associated with financial derivatives
Swap contracts
5.91 A swap contract involves the counterparties
exchanging, in accordance with prearranged terms,
cash flows based on the reference prices of the under-
lying items. Swap contracts classified as forward-type
contracts include currency swaps, interest rate swaps,
and cross-currency interest rate swaps. Under a swap
contract, the obligations of each party may arise at
different times, for example, an interest rate swap
for which payments are quarterly for one party and
annual for the other. In such cases, the quarterly
amounts payable by one party prior to payment of the
annual amount payable by the other party are recorded
as transactions in the financial derivative contract.
Other types of arrangements also called swaps but
not meeting the definition above include gold swaps
(see paragraphs 5.55 and 7.58 for a discussion of their
treatment), central bank swap arrangements (see para-
graphs 6.102–6.104), and credit default swaps (see
paragraph 5.93).
5.92 For foreign currency financial derivative swap
contracts, such as currency swaps, it is necessary
to distinguish between a transaction in a financial
derivative contract and transactions in the underly-
ing currencies. At inception, the parties exchange the
underlying financial instruments (usually classified
under other investment). At the time of settlement,
the difference in the values, as measured in the unit
of account at the prevailing exchange rate, of the
currencies swapped are allocated to a transaction
in a financial derivative, with the values swapped
recorded in the relevant other item (usually other
investment).
Credit derivatives
5.93 Credit derivatives are financial derivatives
whose primary purpose is to trade credit risk. They
are designed for trading in loan and security default
risk. In contrast, the financial derivatives described in
the previous paragraphs are mainly related to market
risk, which pertains to changes in the market prices of
securities, commodities, interest, and exchange rates.
Credit derivatives take the form of both forward-type
(total return swaps) and option-type contracts (credit
default swaps). Under a credit default swap, premiums
are paid in return for a cash payment in the event of
a default by the debtor of the underlying instrument.
Like other financial derivatives, credit derivatives are
frequently drawn up under standard master legal agree-
Chapter 5 g Classifications of Financial Assets and Liabilities
ments and involve collateral and margining procedures,
which allow for a means to make a market valuation.

Margins
5.94 Margins are payments of cash or deposits of
collateral that cover actual or potential obligations
incurred. The required provision of margin reflects
market concern over counterparty risk and is standard
in financial derivative markets, especially futures and
exchange-traded options. The classification of margins
depends on whether they are repayable or nonrepayable:

(a) Repayable margin consists of cash or other collat-
eral deposited to protect a counterparty against
default risk. Ownership of the margin remains
with the unit that deposited it. Repayable mar-
gin payments in cash are classified as deposits
(if the debtor’s liabilities are included in broad
money) or in other accounts receivable/payable.
When a repayable margin deposit is made in a
noncash asset (such as securities), no transac-
tion is recorded because no change in economic
ownership has occurred.
(b) Nonrepayable margin payments reduce the finan-
cial liability created through a derivative. In orga-
nized exchanges, nonrepayable margin (sometimes
known as variation margin) is paid daily to meet
liabilities recorded as a consequence of the daily
marking of derivatives to market value. The entity
that pays nonrepayable margin no longer retains
ownership of the margin or has the right to the
risks and rewards of ownership. Nonrepayable
margin payments are classified as transactions in
financial derivatives.
These principles for the classification of margins also
apply more generally to margin calls relating to posi-
tions in other financial assets.

Supplementary detail
5.95 Possible additional supplementary breakdowns
on financial derivatives are by type:

(a) options; and
(b) forward-type contracts.
These types of derivatives are defined in paragraphs
5.85 and 5.88, respectively. Additional supplementary
breakdowns on financial derivatives also are by market
risk categories:

(a) foreign exchange;
(b) single-currency interest rate;
(c) equity;
(d) commodity;
(e) credit; and
(f) other.
In practice, however, individual derivatives may
straddle more than one risk category. In such cases,
derivatives that are simple combinations of exposures
should be reported separately in terms of their indi-
vidual components. Derivatives that cannot be readily
broken down into separable risk components should
be reported in only one risk category. The allocation
of such products with multiple exposures should be
determined by the underlying risk component that is
most significant. However, if there is doubt about the
correct classification of multiexposure derivatives, the
allocation by risk component should be made accord-
ing to the order of precedence adopted by the BIS:
commodities, equities, foreign exchange, and single-
currency interest rate.
Employee stock options
5.96 Employee stock options are options to buy
the equity of a company, offered to employees of the
company as a form of remuneration. In a few cases,
the company that issues the option is a resident of a
different economy from the employee (e.g., where the
employer is a branch or subsidiary of the company to
which the option relates). Employee stock options have
similar pricing behavior to financial derivatives, but
they have a different nature—including arrangements
for the granting and vesting dates—and purpose (i.e.,
to motivate employees to contribute to increasing the
value of the company, rather than to trade risk). If a
stock option granted to employees can be traded on
financial markets without restriction, it is classified as
a financial derivative.
5.97 In some cases, stock options may be provided
to suppliers of goods and services to the enterprise.
Although these are not employees of the enterprise,
for convenience they are also recorded under employee
stock options because their nature and motivation is
similar. (Whereas the corresponding entry for stock
options granted to employees is compensation of

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

C. Arrears
5.99 An additional subclassification can be made for
instruments in arrears. Arrears are defined as amounts
that are both unpaid and past the due date for payment.
Only the amounts past due are classified as arrears—
for example, in the case of overdue installments, only
the overdue part is in arrears.

5.100 Arrears related to exceptional financing are
shown as memorandum items in all cases. (Exceptional
financing is defined and discussed in Appendix 1.)

5.101 Arrears not related to exceptional financing
may be recorded as a supplementary category in total
and under the specific financial asset or liability class
affected. Separate data on arrears may be of analyti-
cal interest when there is evidence of a high or rapidly
rising value of arrears. Measures of other aspects of
impairment of loans and other financial claims are dis-
cussed in paragraphs 7.45–7.54.

5.102 Arrears may be associated with either (a) re-
classification of an existing instrument when a change
in terms is triggered by the provisions of the original
contract, or a change of the nature of the claim when
the settlement of a financial derivative becomes over-
due (see paragraph 5.82); or (b) the creation of a new
instrument as a result of renegotiated terms (also dis-
cussed in paragraph 8.58). In either case, amounts not
paid when due should be included in arrears. A liability
ceases to be in arrears if all overdue payments are met.
The accrual treatment of arrears is discussed in para-
graphs 3.56–3.57.

D. Classification by Maturity
5.103 The maturity of a debt instrument is classified
as either short-term or long-term:

(a) Short-term is defined as payable on demand or
with a maturity of one year or less. (Payable on
demand refers to a decision by the creditor; an
instrument where the debtor can repay at any
time may be short- or long-term.)
(b) Long-term is defined as having a maturity of
more than one year or with no stated maturity
(other than on demand, which is included in
short-term).
This classification provides information on the liquid-
ity dimensions of debt. Currency is included in short-
term maturity. Because of the nature of the relationship
between the parties, in the case in which the maturity is
unknown, all intercompany lending (which is defined in

paragraph 6.26) may be classified as long-term maturity
by convention. Insurance reserves, pension entitlements,
and standardized guarantee provisions can potentially
be classified by the maturity; however, if data are not
available, a convention that they are all long-term can be
adopted. When securities contain an embedded option
with a date on which or after which the debt can be put
(sold) back to the debtor by the creditor, the maturity
is determined without reference to these embedded put
options. If significant in presenting remaining maturity
data (see paragraph 5.105), supplementary data could
be provided on long-term securities whose maturity is
within one year or less assuming early repayment at the
option date. Financial derivatives could also potentially
be classified according to maturity.
5.104 Maturity may relate to:
(a) original maturity (i.e., the period from issue until
the final contractually scheduled payment); or
(b) remaining maturity (i.e., the period from the
reference date until the final contractually
scheduled payment). This is also called residual
maturity.
In this Manual , original maturity is used in the stan-
dard components, while remaining maturity is used in
Table A9-IV of Appendix 9 and is encouraged for some
position data.
5.105 Data on both original and remaining maturity
bases are accommodated by using the following split:
(a) short-term on an original maturity basis;
(b) long-term due for payment within one year or
less; and
(c) long-term due for payment in more than one
year.
Item (b) can be combined with item (a) to derive lia-
bilities due within a year, that is, short-term debt on a
remaining maturity basis. Alternatively, item (b) can be
combined with (c) to derive long-term debt on an origi-
nal maturity basis. The remaining maturity breakdown
is recommended in this Manual for outstanding debt
liabilities to nonresidents by sector and instrument (see
Table A9-IV of Appendix 9).
E. Classification by Currency
5.106 A financial asset or liability may be classified
as domestic currency or foreign currency, according to
its unit of account, denomination, or settlement. These
terms are discussed in paragraphs 3.95–3.97.
Chapter 5 g Classifications of Financial Assets and Liabilities
5.107 Table A9-I of Appendix 9 provides a format for
presenting the currency composition of outstanding debt
claims and liabilities using the currency of denomina-
tion. This table includes a currency breakdown of reserve
assets into currencies held that are in the SDR basket and
those that are not. In recognition that for some sectors,
such as nonfinancial corporations and households, there
may be difficulties in obtaining comprehensive data from
reporters, the table includes an “unallocated” row.

5.108 In Table A9-I of Appendix 9, by convention,
SDR holdings, reserve position in the IMF, and mon-
etary gold are to be classified as reserve assets in the
SDR basket. It also includes financial derivatives with
nonresidents to receive and to pay foreign currency. A
financial derivatives contract to purchase foreign cur-
rency with domestic currency is classified as a financial
derivative to receive foreign currency. If instead the con-
tract is to purchase domestic currency with foreign cur-
rency at a future date, this is a financial derivative to pay
foreign currency. Similarly, an option to buy foreign cur-
rency (sell domestic currency) is classified as a financial
derivative to receive foreign currency, and vice versa.^11
The decisive factor in determining whether the financial
derivative is to be classified as to receive or to pay for-
eign currency is the exposure to currency movements.
Thus, if payment of a financial derivatives contract is
linked to a foreign currency, even though payment is
required in domestic currency, the financial derivative is
to be classified as a contract to pay foreign currency, and
vice versa. If a single financial derivatives contract both
pays and receives foreign currency, the notional amount
should be included under both categories (i.e., to pay and
to receive foreign currency).^12

F. Classification by Type of Interest Rate
5.109 Debt instruments may be classified as either
variable-rate or fixed-rate. This breakdown may be useful
for some analysis, in that variable-rate instruments are sub-
ject to fluctuation in income flows in response to changes
in market conditions, while fixed-rate securities are more
subject to changes in prices. The split may be considered
as possible supplementary information, as in External
Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users.

(^11) There may be analytical interest in distinguishing the financial
derivatives data in Table A9-I between positions in options and posi-
tions in forwards, as in Table A9-III in Appendix 9.
(^12) Paragraph 5.95 provides further detail on the classification of
financial derivatives contracts by risk categories when there is doubt
about the correct classification of multiexposure derivatives.
5.110 Variable-rate debt instruments are those for
which interest is linked to a reference index—for exam-
ple, LIBOR (London interbank offered rate), or the
price of a specific commodity, or the price of a specific
financial instrument that normally changes over time
in a continuous manner in response to market condi-
tions. All other debt instruments should be classified as
fixed-rate. An interest rate that is adjusted, but only at
intervals of more than a year, is considered to be fixed.
Interest that is adjusted each one year or less is consid-
ered to be variable.
5.111 Interest on debt that is linked to the credit
rating of another borrower should be classified as
fixed-rate, because credit ratings do not change in a
continuous manner in response to market conditions,
whereas interest on debt that is linked to a reference
price index should be classified as variable-rate, pro-
vided that the prices that are the basis for the reference
index are primarily market determined.
5.112 The classification of a financial asset or liabil-
ity can change over time, for example, if it switches
from fixed- to variable-rate interest. In the period when
a fixed rate is applied, the financial asset or liability is to
be classified as fixed-rate debt. After the rate switches
to variable, it is classified as variable-rate debt.
5.113 Index-linked instruments are classified as
being variable-rate. For these instruments, the princi-
pal or coupons or both are indexed to some variable, for
example, to a general or specific price index. Because
index-linked instruments have variable aspects, an
instrument is classified as variable-rate if the index-
ation applies to the principal or coupons, or both (not-
withstanding the treatment of interest discussed in
paragraphs 11.59–11.65). However, a foreign-currency-
linked instrument (as discussed in paragraph 11.50(b))
is treated as being denominated in the foreign currency,
rather than indexed to it.
5.114 If interest is linked to a reference index, com-
modity price, or financial instrument price but is fixed
unless the reference index or price passes a particular
threshold, it should be regarded as fixed-rate. But if there-
after interest becomes variable, then it should be reclassi-
fied as a variable-rate instrument. Alternatively, if interest
is variable-rate until it reaches a predetermined ceiling or
floor, the instrument becomes fixed-rate debt when that
ceiling or floor is reached. If the income stream of a vari-
able-rate instrument is swapped with the income stream
of a fixed-rate instrument, the swap is recorded as giving
rise to a financial derivative, while the classification of the
original debt instruments is unchanged.

Chapter 6. Functional Categories
A. Introduction
6.1 The functional categories^1 are the primary clas-
sification used for each of financial transactions, posi-
tions, and income in the international accounts. Five
functional categories of investment are distinguished in
the international accounts:

(a) direct investment,
(b) portfolio investment,
(c) financial derivatives (other than reserves) and
employee stock options,
(d) other investment, and
(e) reserve assets.
6.2 The functional categories are built on the clas-
sification of financial assets and liabilities discussed in
Chapter 5, but with an additional dimension that takes
into account some aspects of the relationship between
the parties and the motivation for investment. The
functional categories are designed to facilitate analysis
by distinguishing categories that exhibit different eco-
nomic motivations and patterns of behavior.

6.3 While linked to the classification of financial
assets and liabilities, the functional categories highlight
features that are particularly relevant for understanding
cross-border financial flows and positions. For exam-
ple, a loan can appear under direct investment or other
investment, but the different nature of the relationship
between the parties in these two cases has analytical
significance because the risks and motivations behind
the transaction may be different.

6.4 A different relationship exists between the
counterparties for portfolio investors compared with
direct investors. Direct investment is related to con-
trol or a significant degree of influence, and tends to

(^1) The term functional classification is also used in different con-
texts in other areas of statistics, such as the classification of the
functions of government.
be associated with a lasting relationship. As well as
funds, direct investors may supply additional contri-
butions such as know-how, technology, management,
and marketing. Furthermore, enterprises in a direct
investment relationship are more likely to trade with
and finance each other.
6.5 In contrast to direct investors, portfolio inves-
tors typically have less of a role in the decision making
of the enterprise with potentially important implica-
tions for future flows and for the volatility of the price
and volume of positions. Portfolio investment differs
from other investment in that it provides a direct way
to access financial markets, and thus it can provide
liquidity and flexibility. It is associated with financial
markets and with their specialized service providers,
such as exchanges, dealers, and regulators. The nature
of financial derivatives as instruments through which
risk is traded in its own right in financial markets sets
them apart from other types of investment. Whereas
other instruments may also have risk transfer ele-
ments, these other instruments also provide financial
or other resources.
6.6 Reserve assets are shown separately because
they serve a different function and thus are managed
in different ways from other assets. Reserve assets
include a range of instruments that are shown under
other categories when not owned by monetary authori-
ties. As reserve assets, however, they have the distinct
motive to meet balance of payments financing needs
and undertake market intervention to influence the
exchange rate.
6.7 Monetary and financial statistics and flow of
funds data primarily use the instruments classifica-
tion, as shown in Chapter 5, so it is desirable that
data on the same basis can be derived from the inter-
national accounts for compatibility. Table 6.1 shows
the linkages between the financial assets classifica-
tion shown in Chapter 5 and the functional categories
shown in this chapter.

ment (OECD), OECD Benchmark Definition of

1. Definition of direct investment

6.8 Direct investment is a category of cross-border
investment associated with a resident in one economy

having control or a significant degree of influence on the
management of an enterprise that is resident in another
economy. As well as the equity that gives rise to control
or influence, direct investment also includes investment
associated with that relationship, including investment in
indirectly influenced or controlled enterprises (paragraph
6.12), investment in fellow enterprises (see paragraph
6.17), debt (except selected debt set out in paragraph
6.28), and reverse investment (see paragraph 6.40). The
Framework for Direct Investment Relationships (FDIR)
provides criteria for determining whether cross-border
ownership results in a direct investment relationship,

based on control and influence.^2 The definition of direct
investment is the same as in the fourth edition of the
OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Invest-
ment , which provides additional details on the FDIR and
the collection of direct investment data. Appendix 6a,
Topical Summary—Direct Investment, provides refer-
ences to paragraphs in which different aspects of direct
investment are discussed in this Manual.

a. Definition of a direct investment relationship

6.9 A direct investment relationship arises when
an investor resident in one economy makes an invest-
ment that gives control or a significant degree of
influence on the management of an enterprise that is
resident in another economy. Operational definitions
of control and influence are given in paragraph 6.12.
Enterprises in a direct investment relationship with
each other are called affiliates or affiliated enter-
prises. In addition, all enterprises that are under the
control or influence of the same direct investor are
considered to be in a direct investment relationship
with each other.

6.10 Because there is control or a significant degree
of influence, direct investment tends to have differ-
ent motivations and to behave in different ways from
other forms of investment. As well as equity (which is
associated with voting power), the direct investor may
also supply other types of finance, as well as know-
how. Direct investment tends to involve a lasting rela-
tionship, although it may be a short-term relationship
in some cases. Another feature of direct investment
is that decisions by enterprises may be made for the
group as a whole.

b. Definitions of direct investor and direct
investment enterprise

6.11 A direct investor is an entity or group of
related entities that is able to exercise control or a
significant degree of influence over another entity that
is resident of a different economy. A direct investment
enterprise is an entity subject to control or a signifi-
cant degree of influence by a direct investor. In some
cases, a single entity may be, at the same time, a direct

(^2) The coverage of direct investment is determined from the rela-
tionship between the owner and issuer of the financial instrument.
That is, it is not determined from the relationship between the
buyer and the seller of the instrument. For example, if a direct
investor buys shares in its direct investment enterprise from an
unrelated party, the direct investor will classify the purchase as
direct investment.
investor, a direct investment enterprise, and a fellow
enterprise (defined in paragraph 6.17(c)) in its relation-
ships to other enterprises.
c. Definitions of control and influence—definitions
of immediate and indirect relationships
6.12 Control or influence may be achieved directly
by owning equity that gives voting power in the enter-
prise, or indirectly by having voting power in another
enterprise that has voting power in the enterprise.
Accordingly, two ways of having control or influence
are identified:
(a) Immediate direct investment relationships
arise when a direct investor directly owns equity
that entitles it to 10 percent or more of the vot-
ing power in the direct investment enterprise.

Control is determined to exist if the direct
investor owns more than 50 percent of the vot-
ing power in the direct investment enterprise.
A significant degree of influence is determined
to exist if the direct investor owns from 10 to
50 percent of the voting power in the direct
investment enterprise.
(b) Indirect direct investment relationships arise
through the ownership of voting power in one
direct investment enterprise that owns voting
power in another enterprise or enterprises, that
is, an entity is able to exercise indirect control
or influence through a chain of direct investment
relationships. For example, an enterprise may
have an immediate direct investment relationship
with a second enterprise that has an immediate
direct investment relationship with a third enter-
prise. Although the first enterprise has no equity
in the third enterprise, it may be able to exercise
indirect control or influence, according the FDIR
criteria specified in paragraph 6.14.
In addition to direct investment relationships between
two enterprises that arise because one enterprise con-
trols or influences the other, there are also direct invest-
ment relationships between two enterprises that do not
control or influence each other, but that are both under
the control or influence of the same investor (i.e., fellow
enterprises, as discussed in paragraph 6.17).
6.13 In practice, effective control or influence may
arise in some cases with less than these percentages.
These definitions should be used in all cases, however,
for international consistency and to avoid subjective
judgments.
Chapter 6 g Functional Categories
6.14 The principles for indirect transmission of con-
trol and influence through a chain of ownership for the
purposes of paragraph 6.12(b) are as follows:

(a) Control can be passed down a chain of ownership
as long as control exists at each stage.
(b) Influence can be generated at any point down a
chain of control.
(c) Influence can be passed only through a chain of
control but not beyond.
Whereas the FDIR applies a criterion of 10 per-
cent or more of voting power for immediate direct
investment, transmission through chains of owner-
ship is not linked to a particular equity share, but a
chain of control. For example, a chain of ownership
of enterprises with each link involving 60 percent
of the voting power involves a chain of control,
even though the indirect equity by the top enterprise
is 36 percent at the second level (i.e., 60 percent
of 60 percent), 21.6 percent at the third level (i.e.,
60 percent of 36 percent), and so on. The appli-
cation of these principles may be understood more
readily by numerical examples—see Box 6.1 and
the OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct
Investment.

d. Definitions of subsidiaries, associates, fellow
enterprises, and affiliates
6.15 In regard to its relationship with a direct inves-
tor, a direct investment enterprise is either a subsidiary
or an associate:
(a) A subsidiary is a direct investment enterprise
over which the direct investor is able to exercise
control.
(b) An associate is a direct investment enterprise over
which the direct investor is able to exercise a sig-
nificant degree of influence, but not control.
Control and influence are defined in paragraph 6.12
and may arise from an immediate relationship or
in indirect relationship through a chain of owner-
ship. The terms subsidiary and associate refer to both
incorporated and unincorporated enterprises. The
FDIR makes no distinction on the basis of incorpora-
tion, so directly owned branches are always treated
as subsidiaries.
6.16 Under the FDIR, an entity is a direct investor in
another entity where the second entity is
(a) an immediate subsidiary of the direct investor;
(b) an immediate associate of the direct investor;
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Each enterprise is resident in a different economy from
the others. Shaded boxes are direct investment enter-
prises of the Direct Investor A (so all are affiliates of
each other).
For further examples, see the OECD Benchmark Defini-
tion of Foreign Direct Investment. In particular, it consid-
ers more complex situations, such as where an enterprise
receives investment from two members of the same group.

(c) a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the direct investor
(also considered to be an indirect subsidiary of
the direct investor);
(d) a subsidiary of an associate of the direct investor
(also considered to be an indirect associate of the
direct investor); or
(e) an associate of a subsidiary of the direct investor
(also considered to be an indirect associate of the
direct investor).
However, no direct investor–direct investment enter-
prise relationship exists in cases in which the entity is
an associate of an associate of the direct investor. In
this case, the ability of the investor to influence the
management of the entity is considered to have become
too diluted to be significant.

(These principles are illustrated in Box 6.1.)

6.17 Affiliates of an enterprise consist of:
(a) its direct investor(s), both immediate and
indirect;
(b) its direct investment enterprises, whether sub-
sidiaries (including branches and other quasi-
corporations), associates, and subsidiaries of
associates, both immediate and indirect; and
(c) fellow enterprises , that is, those enterprises
that are under the control or influence of the
same immediate or indirect investor, but nei-
ther fellow enterprise controls or influences the
other fellow enterprise. Often the direct investor
and fellow enterprises are all in different econo-
mies, but sometimes the direct investor is in the
same economy as one of the fellow enterprises
(in which case, it is not a direct investor in that
fellow enterprise). This situation is more likely
to arise in economies that do not use a local
enterprise group as the statistical unit for direct
investment purposes.
All affiliates are in a direct investment relationship
with each other. The term affiliated enterprises is also
used, because affiliates are almost always enterprises
(the exception is a direct investor that is an individual,
household, or government).

6.18 Some practical difficulties may be encountered
in applying the FDIR in full, and thus similar methods—
such as the participation multiplication method and the
direct influence and indirect control method-may be
adopted. For details, see OECD Benchmark Definition
of Foreign Direct Investment and the IMF’s Coordinated
Direct Investment Survey Guide.

e. Requirements for a direct investment
relationship
6.19 Voting power is obtained as a result of owner-
ship of equity. When decisions are made on a one-share
one-vote basis, voting power is in the same proportion as
the ownership of ordinary shares. In some cases, voting
power can be exercised without commensurate owner-
ship of shares. For instance, for unincorporated entities,
including foundations, there are no shares in the sense of
a tradable instrument. Additionally, voting power may be
greater or less than percentage of shares held when there
are “golden shares” or dual classes of shares (i.e., in cases
in which nonvoting shares or some shares have higher
weights that allow one or more parties to exercise vot-
ing power disproportionately to their share ownership).
However, voting power is not recognized if temporarily
obtained through repurchase agreements (because no
change in the economic ownership of the shares has
occurred) or through the holding of warrants (because
the warrant holder does not possess voting power until
the warrants are exercised). In addition, as elaborated in
the FDIR, one entity may obtain voting power indirectly
in an enterprise by owning shares in an intermediate
entity or through chains of intermediate entities that, in
turn, own shares in the enterprise.
6.20 A direct investor could be:
(a) an individual or household;
(b) an enterprise, incorporated or unincorporated,
public or private;
(c) an investment fund;
(d) a government or international organization. Spe-
cial treatments for governments that have direct
investment enterprises for fiscal purposes are
discussed in paragraphs 8.24–8.26;
(e) a nonprofit institution in an enterprise that oper-
ates for profit; however, the relationship between
two nonprofit institutions is excluded from direct
investment;
(f) an estate, trustee in bankruptcy, or other trust;
or
(g) any combination of two or more of the above.
6.21 For two or more individuals or other entities
to be considered a combination, and thus be regarded
as a single direct investor, they must be in a direct
investment relationship or have a family relationship
(in the case of individuals). The different individuals
or other entities must be resident in the same economy
as each other. They cannot include any investor that is
Chapter 6 g Functional Categories
a resident of the same economy as the direct investment
enterprise. Equity ownership in an enterprise held by a
group of related investors acting in combination can be
summed to establish either control or influence. How-
ever, equity held by an associate is not summed with
that from any other enterprise to establish either control
or influence because influence is not able to be passed
unless there is control of the next affiliate (this concept
is illustrated in Box 6.2).

6.22 A government may be a direct investor. Spe-
cial treatments of positions and transactions apply
when a government has a direct investment enterprise
that is used for fiscal purposes, discussed further in
paragraphs 8.24–8.26. If a government equity holding
could qualify as both direct investment and reserve
assets, it is included in direct investment, whereas
debt instruments are classified as reserve assets pro-
vided that the reserve asset criteria are met (see also
paragraph 6.98).
6.23 A nonprofit institution may not be a direct
investment enterprise, as it is not created with the inten-
tion of repatriating earnings to its investor. However, a
nonprofit institution may be a direct investor in a for-
profit entity.
6.24 A direct investment enterprise is always a cor-
poration, which as a statistical term includes branches,
notional resident units, trusts, other quasi-corporations,
and investment funds, as well as incorporated entities.
Because a direct investment enterprise is owned by
another entity, households or governments can be direct
investors, but they cannot be direct investment enter-
prises. A public corporation, as defined in paragraphs
4.108–4.112, in some instances also may be a direct
investment enterprise.
2. Coverage of direct investment flows and
positions
6.25 Direct investment covers most financial transac-
tions and positions between affiliates resident in differ-
ent economies. Investment income associated with direct
investment positions is also included in direct investment.
The exceptions are noted in paragraphs 6.28–6.32.

a. Coverage of debt between affiliates
Definition of intercompany lending
6.26 Intercompany lending is used to describe
direct investment debt positions between affiliated
enterprises. It includes debt instrument transactions
and positions other than those excluded by paragraph
6.28; it is not limited to loans. As shown in Tables
I and III in Appendix 9, Standard Components and
Selected Other Items, and External Debt Statistics:
Guide for Compilers and Users , intercompany lending
is identified separately from other debt for debt analy-
sis, because this lending has different implications for
risk and vulnerability compared with debt between
unrelated parties. Splits of intercompany lending by
type of instrument and maturity are supplementary

A is a direct investor in D because its own immediate

For the same reason, B is also a direct investor in D

6.27 Although debt and other claims that do not
involve voting power are not relevant to defining a direct
investment relationship, they are included in direct invest-
ment transactions and positions if a direct investment
relationship exists between the parties. Debt instruments
other than monetary gold, SDRs, currency, interbank
positions, and pension and related entitlements poten-
tially can be included in direct investment. However
transactions between affiliates in financial assets issued
by an unrelated third party are not direct investment
transactions. Insurance technical reserves are included in
direct investment when the parties are in a direct invest-
ment relationship. For example, reserves may arise from
reinsurance contracts between affiliated insurance cor-
porations. They also arise with captive direct insurance.
(A captive insurance company writes insurance policies
largely or entirely with its owners and other affiliates.)

Coverage of debt between selected affiliated
financial corporations
6.28 Debt between selected affiliated financial cor-
porations is not classified as direct investment because
it is not considered to be so strongly connected to the
direct investment relationship. The financial corpora-
tions covered by this case are:

(a) deposit-taking corporations (both central banks
and deposit-taking corporations other than the
central bank);
(b) investment funds; and
(c) other financial intermediaries except insurance
corporations and pension funds.
In other words, the usual direct investment defini-
tions apply for captive financial institutions and money
lenders, insurance corporations, pension funds, and
financial auxiliaries. (These subsectors are defined in
Chapter 4, Section D; debt instruments are defined in
paragraphs 5.31–5.33.) All debt positions between the
selected types of affiliated financial corporations are
excluded from direct investment and are included under
portfolio or other investment. Both affiliated parties
must be one of the selected types of financial corpora-
tions, but they need not be the same type.

b. Coverage of other financial instruments

6.29 Financial derivatives and employee stock
options are excluded from direct investment and

included in the functional category financial deriva-
tives (other than reserves) and employee stock options.
6.30 Investment funds may be direct investors or
direct investment enterprises. A “fund of funds” is
an investment fund that invests in other investment
funds and thus may become a direct investor in one of
the funds. In a master-feeder fund arrangement, one
or more investment funds (feeder funds) pool their
portfolio in another fund (the master fund). In this
case, a feeder fund that has 10 percent or more of the
voting power in the master fund would meet the FDIR
definition of a direct investor. Similarly, retail funds
that hold 10 percent or more of voting power in an
enterprise are direct investors.
6.31 Direct investment may include real estate
investment, including investment properties and vaca-
tion homes. As discussed in paragraphs 4.26–4.40,
branches or notional units are identified when nonresi-
dents own real estate and other natural resources. The
normal ownership threshold for influence or control
under the FDIR is applied. Because it may have differ-
ent motivations and economic impact from other direct
investment, if real estate investment is significant, com-
pilers may wish to publish data on such investment
separately on a supplementary basis.
6.32 Equity in international organizations is excluded
from direct investment, even in cases in which voting
power is 10 percent or more, so equity contributions are
included in portfolio investment (if in the form of secu-
rities) or other investment—equity (if not in the form of
securities). Equity in international organizations would
not generally qualify as reserve assets because of the
lack of ready availability (see paragraph 6.69).
c. Pass-through funds
6.33 “Pass-through funds” or “funds in transit”
are funds that pass through an enterprise resident
in an economy to an affiliate in another economy,
so that the funds do not stay in the economy of
that enterprise. These funds are often associated
with direct investment. Such flows have little impact
on the economy they pass through. Special purpose
entities, holding companies, and financial institu-
tions that serve other nonfinancial affiliates are par-
ticularly associated with funds in transit, but other
enterprises may also have pass-through funds in
direct investment flows.
6.34 Pass-through funds are included in direct
investment in standard presentations because:
Chapter 6 g Functional Categories
(a) they are an integral part of a direct investor’s
financial transactions and positions with affili-
ated enterprises;
(b) the exclusion of these funds from direct invest-
ment would distort and substantially understate
direct investment financial flows and positions
at aggregate levels; and
(c) the inclusions of these data in direct investment
promotes symmetry and consistency among
economies.
However, for the economies through which the funds
pass, it is useful to identify inflows and outflows not
intended for use by the entity concerned. At the time
of writing, there are no standard definitions or meth-
ods to distinguish pass-through funds from other direct
investment flows. Compilers in economies that have
large values of pass-through funds should consider the
compilation of supplementary data on funds in transit,
based on national definitions.

d. Effect of domestic ownership links on direct
investment relationships

6.35 To identify direct investment relationships,
the FDIR does not exclude ownership links between
enterprises resident in the same economy. Although
any transactions and positions between enterprises in
the same economy are not included in international
accounts, it is possible that a direct investor may have

a chain of control or influence in which one link in
the chain is a resident-to-resident relationship. Such
a relationship does not preclude a direct investment
relationship between two enterprises that are resident
in different economies from each other. (This case is
illustrated in Box 6.3.)
e. Beginning and ending direct investment
relationships
6.36 The whole of the transaction that reaches or
surpasses the threshold of 10 percent or more of voting
power is included under direct investment. Any trans-
actions before that point are not generally classified
as direct investment (with the exception of reverse
investment—defined in paragraph 6.37(b)—and
investment in other affiliates). Any prior positions are
shown as being reclassified at the time that the direct
investment relationship comes into existence (reclas-
sifications are discussed in paragraphs 9.13–9.20). For
example, if the direct investor previously had 9 per-
cent of voting power, then acquired 2 percent more,
there would be a direct investment transaction by the
purchaser involving 2 percent of voting power, and the
reclassification entries in the other changes in financial
assets and liabilities account would show a reduction
of portfolio investment involving the previously held
9 percent and a corresponding increase in direct invest-
ment. Subsequent transactions up to and including a
transaction that takes the voting power below 10 per-
cent are classified as direct investment. Once the direct
investment equity threshold has been crossed (either
upward or downward), any debt positions between the
parties should also be changed by a reclassification
entry in the other changes in volume account.
3. Types of direct investment transactions and
positions

6.37 In the standard components, direct investment is
classified according to the relationship between the inves-
tor and the entity receiving the investment, namely:
(a) investment by a direct investor in its direct
investment enterprise (whether in an immediate
relationship or not);
(b) reverse investment by a direct investment enter-
prise in its own immediate or indirect direct
investor, as explained in paragraphs 6.39–6.40;
and
(c) investment between resident and nonresident fel-
low enterprises, as explained in paragraph 6.17.

A wholly owns B, which wholly owns C, which wholly

In this example, despite the domestic link between B

ship with D.
Box 6.3. Direct Investment Relationship
Involving Domestic Link
A
B C
D
6.38 These three categories reflect different types
of relationships and motivations. For example, the
interpretation of a direct investor acquiring direct
investment assets is different from a direct invest-
ment enterprise acquiring direct investment assets.
While the first type of investment involves influence
or control, this may not be the case for the other two
types, because the investor is not a direct investor. It
is important for compilers to monitor trends in the
second and third types to identify if they are becom-
ing significant.

a. Reverse investment

6.39 A direct investment enterprise may acquire
an equity or other claim on its own immediate or
indirect direct investor. These transactions may
occur as a way of withdrawing investment, or as
a way of organizing finance within a transnational
group. For example, for an enterprise that borrows on
behalf of its parent company and in cases in which
treasury functions are concentrated in a subsidiary
(see paragraphs 4.83(d) and 4.86), the subsidiary
may lend money to its direct investor.

6.40 Reverse investment arises when a direct invest-
ment enterprise lends funds to or acquires equity in its
immediate or indirect direct investor, provided it does
not own equity comprising 10 percent or more of the
voting power in that direct investor. In contrast, if two
enterprises each have 10 percent or more of the vot-
ing power in the other, there is not reverse investment,
rather there are two mutual direct investment relation-
ships. That is, each enterprise is both a direct investor
and direct investment enterprise of the other.

6.41 Data on reverse investment and investment
between fellow enterprises should be separately pub-
lished, where significant, to assist users in understand-
ing the nature of direct investment. Issues associated
with income on reverse investment and investment
between fellow enterprises are covered in paragraphs
11.99 –11.10 0.

b. Presentation of data according to the
directional principle

6.42 The directional principle is a presentation
of direct investment data organized according to the
direction of the direct investment relationship. It can
be contrasted with the asset and liability presentation
of aggregates used in standard components in this
Manual , which are organized according to whether the
investment relates to an asset or liability. The difference

between the asset-liability and directional presenta-
tions arises from differences in the treatment of reverse
investment and some investment between fellow enter-
prises. The directional principle can be applied to the
IIP, financial account, and investment income. Under
the directional principle, direct investment is shown as
either direct investment abroad or direct investment in
the reporting economy:
(a) Direct investment abroad covers assets and
liabilities between resident direct investors and
their direct investment enterprises. It also cov-
ers assets and liabilities between resident and
nonresident fellow enterprises if the ultimate
controlling parent is resident. Direct investment
abroad is also called outward direct investment.
(b) Direct investment in the reporting economy
includes all liabilities and assets between resi-
dent direct investment enterprises and their direct
investors. It also covers assets and liabilities
between resident and nonresident fellow enter-
prises if the ultimate controlling parent is nonres-
ident. Direct investment in the reporting economy
is also called inward direct investment.
6.43 The treatment of fellow enterprises under the
directional principle is as follows:
In principle, all assets and liabilities between fellow
enterprises are shown in direct investment abroad
when the ultimate controlling parent is a resident.
In that case, control and influence is exercised
from the economy of the resident, so it is useful to
view an investment in a fellow enterprise abroad in
the same way as outward investment.
In principle, all assets and liabilities between fel-
low enterprises are shown in direct investment in
the reporting economy when the ultimate control-
ling parent is a nonresident. In this case, control and
influence are exercised from another economy, so it
is useful to view investment with the fellow enter-
prise abroad in the same way as inward investment.
However, if the residence of the ultimate con-
trolling parent is unknown, assets are treated as
direct investment abroad and liabilities are treated
as direct investment in the reporting economy.
This treatment is allowed for practical reasons. It
is recognized that, in some cases, economies may
not be able to implement the preferred or “in prin-
ciple” basis of presentation in their direct invest-
ment data, because they cannot identify ultimate
controlling parents.
Chapter 6 g Functional Categories
c. Analytical use of the different presentations of
direct investment

6.44 Data on both the asset and liability presenta-
tion and the directional principle presentation are use-
ful for different kinds of analysis.

Data on an asset and liability basis are consistent
with monetary, financial, and other balance sheet
data, and thus facilitate comparison between the
data sets. These data are needed on an immediate
counterparty basis to adequately monitor flows
and positions. For instance, if a jurisdiction of
convenience that is the home to large SPEs were
to experience a currency or other financial crisis,
data users would find data sets that look through
the SPEs (or that net data for SPEs without sepa-
rate identification of gross levels) to be of limited
help. SPEs and other entities may transform debt
to equity, a long-term instrument to short-term,
local currency to foreign currency, fixed to vari-
able rates, and so on, and these transformations
alter risk characteristics in important ways.
Data on a directional principle basis assist in
understanding the motivation for direct investment
and take account of control and influence. In the
directional presentation, reverse investment can
be seen as equivalent to the withdrawal of invest-
ment. The directional principle may be particu-
larly useful for an economy with large values of
pass-through funds or round tripping, because the
large investment flows into and out of an economy
may not be of primary interest to analysts of direct
investment.
6.45 The calculations and relationship between the
asset and liability and the directional presentations
are shown in Box 6.4. In this Manual , the directional
presentation appears as supplementary items. Under
the directional principle, direct investment abroad and
direct investment in the reporting economy include
both assets and liabilities, and thus, negative values
may arise.
4. Other issues concerning direct investment
transactions, positions, and income
a. Round tripping

6.46 Round tripping involves funds from an entity
in one economy being invested in an entity resident in
a second economy, that are then invested in another
entity in the first economy. The entity in the second
economy often has limited operations of its own. (There

may be two or other intermediate economies with round
tripping.) Its special nature means that, where it is sig-
nificant, compilers should consider publishing supple-
mentary information on the extent of round tripping.
(Round tripping results in an economy being its own
ultimate host economy or ultimate investing economy
in partner data.)
b. Relationships other than direct investment
6.47 Some relationships involve cooperation between
enterprises that resemble direct investment relations.
However, such cases should not be classified as direct
investment unless they meet the definition involving
control or influence through voting power. For example,
there may be representation on the board of directors,
a common board of directors but no formal relation-
ship, participation in policymaking processes, material
intercompany transactions, interchange of managerial
personnel, provision of technical information, or provi-
sion of long-term loans at lower than existing market
rates. Creditors of an insolvent company may exercise
influence or even effectively control it, but they would
not qualify as direct investors unless their debt is con-
verted to equity with voting power. Furthermore, an
enterprise may have substantial foreign ownership but
no individual investor or group of related investors may
have a direct investment stake.
c. Additional detail for direct investment
6.48 The financial instrument, maturity, and currency
classifications in Chapter 5 can be used for direct invest-
ment. Compilers should break down debt instruments
relating to direct investment relationships according to
the SNA/MFSM instrument classification on a supple-
mentary basis. The split by type of instrument is neces-
sary for reconciliation with financial account, flow of
funds, and sector balance sheets, because these data use
the instrument classification and not the international
accounts functional classification. However, because of
the relationship between the two parties, the strictness
of terms, and risks and vulnerability aspects of direct
investment-related debt may differ from those of other
debt. For those reasons, intercompany lending is identi-
fied separately in External Debt Statistics: Guide for
Compilers and Users (see also paragraph 6.26).
6.49 Classification by partner economy is discussed
in paragraphs 4.146–4.164, with paragraphs 4.156–4.157
dealing with direct investment. Partner data for direct
investment can be classified according to either the
immediate or ultimate investor or host economy. The
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

institutional sector classification (described in Chapter
4, Section D) may also be applied to direct investment.
These issues are discussed further in the OECD Bench-
mark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment.

6.50 Classification by kind of economic activity
(industry) may be of interest for direct investment. The
ISIC or some regional or national equivalent can be
used to compile data on the kind of economic activity.
Although this classification is not used for other func-
tional categories, it is useful for direct investment. It
is preferable to prepare estimates on both inward and

outward direct investment on a dual basis, based on the
industry of the direct investment enterprise and the indus-
try of the direct investor. If data on only one basis can be
prepared, the preferred industry classification is that of
the direct investment enterprise. Industrial classification
applies to units, rather than transactions. Often in direct
investment data, the industry classification is applied
to economy-specific enterprise groups, or to economy-
specific enterprise groups in a single institutional sector.
If a direct investment enterprise or enterprise group is
involved in different economic activities, it is classified
according to the predominant activity.

tions and transactions are shown in the table below. They

d. Further issues concerning direct investment

6.51 In addition to the classification issues in this
chapter, direct investment is discussed in the chapters
concerning positions, financial account transactions,
and primary income (Chapters 7, 8, and 11, respec-
tively). The cross-cutting issues and links are shown in
Appendix 6a.

6.52 Some aspects of direct investment—other than
those directly related to balance of payments and inter-
national investment position data—may be of interest,
particularly in the host economy, from analytical and
policymaking points of view. While the international
accounts data show the cross-border flows and stocks,
another aspect of the impact of direct investment is on
domestic variables such as employment, sales, value
added, and gross fixed capital formation. These statis-
tics are called Activities of Multinational Enterprises
and are discussed in Appendix 4.

6.53 The foreign-controlled corporations subsec-
tor in the SNA overlaps with direct investment. The
foreign-controlled corporations subsector includes all
subsidiaries and branches resident in the economy, as
well as any associates or other enterprises resident in
the economy that are under de facto foreign control.

C. Portfolio Investment
6.54 Portfolio investment is defined as cross-
border transactions and positions involving debt or
equity securities, other than those included in direct
investment or reserve assets. Securities are defined in
paragraph 5.15. The negotiability of securities is a way
of facilitating trading, allowing them to be held by dif-
ferent parties during their lives. Negotiability allows
investors to diversify their portfolios and to withdraw
their investment readily. Investment fund shares or units
(i.e., those issued by investment funds) that are evi-
denced by securities and that are not reserve assets or
direct investment are included in portfolio investment.
Although they are negotiable instruments, exchange-
traded financial derivatives are not included in portfo-
lio investment because they are included in their own
separate category.

6.55 Equity not in the form of securities (e.g., in
unincorporated enterprises) is not included in portfolio
investment; it is included in direct or other investment.
Equity in time-share accommodation evidenced by a
security is usually portfolio investment (although hold-
ings that provided 10 percent or more of voting power
would be direct investment, and holdings not in the form

of securities and not included in direct investment would
be other investment). In a few cases identified in para-
graph 6.28, debt securities representing claims on affili-
ated enterprises are included in portfolio investment.
6.56 Portfolio investment covers, but is not limited
to, securities traded on organized or other financial
markets. Portfolio investment usually involves finan-
cial infrastructure, such as a suitable legal, regulatory,
and settlement framework, along with market-making
dealers, and a sufficient volume of buyers and sellers.
However, acquisition of shares in hedge funds, private
equity funds, and venture capital are examples of portfo-
lio investment that occurs in less public and more lightly
regulated markets. (However, shares in these funds are
included in direct investment when the holdings reach
the 10 percent threshold, and in other equity in other
investment when investment is not in the form of a secu-
rity and not included in direct investment or reserve
assets.) Portfolio investment is distinctive because of the
nature of the funds raised, the largely anonymous rela-
tionship between the issuers and holders, and the degree
of trading liquidity in the instruments.
6.57 Portfolio investment may be presented by
instrument, original or remaining maturity, or institu-
tional sector. Further information on portfolio invest-
ment is included in Chapter 7 (concerning positions),
Chapter 8 (concerning financial account transactions),
and Chapter 11 (concerning primary income).
D. Financial Derivatives (Other than Reserves) and Employee Stock Options
6.58 The definition of the functional category
financial derivatives and employee stock options (other
than reserves) largely coincides with the correspond-
ing financial instrument class, which is discussed in
detail in paragraphs 5.79–5.98. The difference in cover-
age between the functional category and the financial
instrument is that financial derivatives associated with
reserve asset management are excluded from the func-
tional category and included in reserve assets (see para-
graph 6.91). This category is identified separately from
the other categories because it relates to risk transfer,
rather than supply of funds or other resources.
6.59 Unlike other functional categories, no primary
income accrues on financial derivatives. Any amounts
accruing under the contract are classified as revalua-
tions and are included in the other changes in assets
and liabilities account. (These entries are discussed in
paragraphs 9.30–9.31.) In addition, as noted in the foot-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

note to paragraph 10.121, an intermediary may provide
services associated with transactions in derivatives.

6.60 Recording of financial derivatives separately for
both assets and liabilities is encouraged for both positions
and transactions. However, it is recognized that measur-
ing transactions on a gross basis may not be feasible, in
which case net reporting is acceptable. Information on
financial derivatives (other than reserves) and employee
stock options is included in Chapter 7 (concerning posi-
tions), Chapter 8 (concerning financial account trans-
actions), and Chapter 9 (concerning revaluations); no
investment income arises (see paragraph 11.95).

E. Other Investment
6.61 Other investment is a residual category that
includes positions and transactions other than those
included in direct investment, portfolio investment, finan-
cial derivatives and employee stock options, and reserve
assets. To the extent that the following classes of financial
assets and liabilities are not included under direct invest-
ment or reserve assets, other investment includes:

(a) other equity;
(b) currency and deposits;
(c) loans (including use of IMF credit and loans
from the IMF);
(d) nonlife insurance technical reserves, life
insurance and annuities entitlements, pension
entitlements, and provisions for calls under stan-
dardized guarantees;
(e) trade credit and advances;
(f) other accounts receivable/payable; and
(g) SDR allocations (SDR holdings are included in
reserve assets).
6.62 Other equity is included in other investment,
when it is not direct investment or reserve assets. Other
equity, as defined in paragraph 5.26, is not in the form
of securities, so it is not included in portfolio investment.
Participation in some international organizations is not in
the form of securities and so it is classified as other equity.
In most cases, equity in quasi-corporations for branches
and notional units for ownership of land is included in
direct investment; however, it is included in other invest-
ment if the share of voting power is less than 10 percent.

6.63 Other investment may be split by financial
asset or liability class, original or remaining maturity,
or institutional sector. Information on other investment
is included in Chapter 7 (concerning valuation of posi-

tions, particularly loans), Chapter 8 (concerning finan-
cial account transactions), and Chapter 11 (concerning
primary income).
F. Reserves^3
Reference:
IMF, International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity: Guidelines for a Data Template.
1. Reserve assets
a. General definition
6.64 Reserve assets are those external assets that
are readily available to and controlled by monetary
authorities for meeting balance of payments financing
needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect
the currency exchange rate, and for other related pur-
poses (such as maintaining confidence in the currency
and the economy, and serving as a basis for foreign
borrowing).^4 Reserve assets must be foreign currency
assets and assets that actually exist. Potential assets are
excluded. Underlying the concept of reserve assets are
the notions of “control,” and “availability for use,” by the
monetary authorities.^5 The composition of reserve assets
and reserve-related liabilities is shown in Box 6.5.

b. Residence
6.65 In accordance with the residence concept,
reserve assets, other than gold bullion, must be claims
on nonresidents. Conversely, the authorities’ foreign
currency claims on residents, including claims on resi-
dent banks, are not reserve assets. Nonetheless, foreign
currency claims on resident banks can be at the dis-
posal of the monetary authorities and can be readily
mobilized to meet demand for foreign exchange. Such
claims are presented as a supplementary item to the
IIP. For the explanation of residence, see Chapter 4,
Section E.
(^3) A more complete picture of monetary authorities’ international
liquidity position is given in International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity: Guidelines for a Data Template (Guidelines).
The Guidelines address a number of key issues, and are drawn on
in this text.
(^4) For dollarized economies, the need to hold reserves for the pur-
pose of intervention in exchange markets is not relevant for defining
the reserve assets of these economies. Dollarization and euroization
are defined in paragraph A3.10.
(^5) Monetary authorities may sometimes employ fund managers to
manage reserve assets. In such arrangements, the fund managers are
acting as agents and are paid a fee for their services.
Chapter 6 g Functional Categories

c. Definition of monetary authorities

6.66 The functional concept of monetary authori-
ties is essential for defining reserve assets. Monetary
authorities encompass the central bank (which sub-
sumes other institutional units included in the central
bank subsector, such as the currency board) and cer-
tain operations usually attributed to the central bank
but sometimes carried out by other government institu-
tions or commercial banks, such as government-owned
commercial banks. Such operations include the issuance
of currency; maintenance and management of reserve
assets,includingthoseresultingfromtransactionswith
theIMF;andoperationofexchangestabilizationfunds.
Ineconomiesinwhichextensivereserveassetsareheld

should be provided on the institutional sector of hold-
ings of those reserve assets.
d. Control
6.67 In general, only external claims actually owned
bythemonetaryauthoritiescanbeclassifiedasreserve
assets.Nonetheless,ownershipisnottheonlycondition
that confers control. In cases in which institutional units
(other than the monetary authorities) in the reporting
economyholdlegaltitletoexternalforeigncurrency
assetsandarepermittedtotransactinsuchassetsonly
on terms specified by the monetary authorities or only
with their express approval. In such cases, the assets
can be considered reserve assets because they are under
thedirectandeffectivecontrolofthemonetaryauthori-
ties. To be counted in reserve assets, the conditions to
be met are that:
theresidententitycantransactonlyinthoseclaims

monetary authorities or only with their express
approval; and
the authorities have access on demand to these
claims on nonresidents to meet balance of pay-
ments financing needs and other related purposes;
and

6.68 If such assets are included under reserve assets,

Box 6.5. Components of Reserve Assets
and Reserve-Related Liabilities

This concept refers to both nonmarketable assets, such
as demand deposits, and marketable assets, such as
securities for which there are ready and willing sell-
ers and buyers. The ability to raise funds by using the
asset as collateral is not sufficient to make an asset a
reserve asset. Some deposits and loans can be liquid
and included in reserve assets, although they are not
necessarily marketable.

6.70 To be readily available to the authorities to
meet balance of payments financing needs and other
related purposes under adverse circumstances, reserve
assets generally should be of high quality.

f. Further clarifications on reserve assets

6.71 As a consequence of their purpose of meeting
balance of payments financing needs, and supporting
the exchange rate, reserve assets must be both denomi-
nated and settled in foreign currency. Denominated is
defined to mean the currency in which the contract is
specified. (Currency of denomination and currency of
settlement are discussed in paragraphs 3.98–3.103.)

6.72 Furthermore to be liquid, reserve assets must
be denominated and settled in convertible foreign cur-
rencies, that is, currencies that are freely usable for
settlements of international transactions.^7 In addition,
assets denominated in gold and SDRs may qualify as
reserve assets.

6.73 In some instances, economies may hold assets
denominated in the currency of a neighboring econ-
omy because the economy’s risk exposures are closely
related to their neighbor given the composition of their
international trade, even though the currency may not
be widely traded. These assets should be excluded from
reserve assets (and included under the appropriate func-
tional category and instrument) if the currency does not
meet the definition of a convertible foreign currency
set out in paragraph 6.72, but supplementary data can
be provided. Such circumstances are envisaged when
an economy is highly dependent on a larger regional
neighbor for its international trading activity.^8

6.74 Assets that are denominated in or indexed to
the domestic currency but settled in foreign currency
cannot be reserve assets, because the value of such
assets would decline along with the domestic currency
in the circumstance of a domestic currency crisis.

(^7) The term “freely usable” is not used in a restrictive sense to cover
the currencies in the SDR basket only.
(^8) It is possible but unlikely that such dependence could arise with
an economy that is not a neighbor.
6.75 An existing asset that is committed for a
future use but not encumbered can be included pro-
vided that the asset is readily available to meet a bal-
ance of payments financing need (and other related
purposes stated in paragraph 6.64). An asset should
not be denied as a reserve asset simply because the
use to which the asset is to be put is a foreseeable one.
However, when an asset is not readily available—such
as an asset whose use is blocked—the asset should not
be counted as reserve assets.
g. Classification of reserve assets
6.76 Reserve assets consist of monetary gold, SDR
holdings, reserve position in the IMF, currency and
deposits, securities (including debt and equity securi-
ties), financial derivatives, and other claims (loans and
other financial instruments).
6.77 Monetary gold, SDR holdings, and reserve
position in the IMF are considered reserve assets
because they are assets readily available to the mon-
etary authorities in unconditional form. Currency and
deposits, securities, and other assets in many instances
are equally available and therefore qualify as reserve
assets.
6.78 Monetary gold is gold to which the monetary
authorities (or others who are subject to the effec-
tive control of the monetary authorities) have title and
is held as reserve assets. It consists of gold bullion
(including gold coins, ingots, bars with a purity of at
least 995/1,000, and gold bullion held in allocated gold
accounts, regardless of the location of the account)^9
and unallocated gold accounts with nonresidents that
give title to claim the delivery of gold.^10 Gold bullion is
usually traded on organized markets or through bilat-
eral arrangements between central banks. To qualify as
reserve assets, gold accounts must be readily available
upon demand to the monetary authorities.
6.79 Allocated and unallocated gold accounts are
to be distinguished from accounts that are linked to
gold (accounts indexed to gold) but do not give title
to claim delivery of gold. The latter are classified as
currency and deposits and are included within reserve
assets provided they meet the criteria of reserves.
6.80 If the monetary authorities deposit gold bul-
lion in an unallocated gold account, the gold bullion is
(^9) However, transactions with residents in gold bullion are not
recorded in the balance of payments (see paragraph 9.18).
(^10) See paragraphs 5.76–5.77 for definitions of allocated and unal-
located gold accounts.
Chapter 6 g Functional Categories

demonetized (see paragraph 9.18) and this is recorded
in the other changes in assets account of the mone-
tary authorities. If the account is with a nonresident,
a transaction in nonmonetary gold is recorded in the
goods and services account. However, transactions
in gold bullion as reserve assets between monetary
authorities and with international financial institutions
are recorded as transactions in gold bullion and are
not recorded as other changes in assets. If the unallo-
cated gold account is with a nonresident and available
on demand, a transaction in currency and deposits is
recorded and then reclassified to monetary gold (unal-
located gold accounts) if held as a reserve asset.^11 How-
ever, if the deposit is with another monetary authority
or an international financial institution, a transaction in
unallocated gold accounts is recorded.

6.81 To minimize risks of default in gold lending
transactions,^12 monetary authorities can require ade-
quate collateral instead of cash (such as securities)
from the depository. Such securities collateral received
should not be included in reserve assets, thereby pre-
venting double counting as the gold lent remains an
asset of the monetary authorities.^13

6.82 Allocated and unallocated gold accounts with
nonresidents out on swap by the monetary authorities
for cash collateral are either (a) included as reserve
assets of the original owner with the loan generated
reported as a reserve-related liability (a memorandum
item) if a liability is to a nonresident,^14 or (b) excluded
from reserve assets and either demonetized (gold bul-
lion) or reclassified as other investment, currency and
deposits, assets (unallocated gold accounts). In either
case, any loan liability to a nonresident is recorded
within “other investment,” with the foreign currency
received (provided it is a claim on a nonresident), and
recorded as an increase in currency and deposits within
reserve assets.^15 The value of allocated and unallocated

(^11) Similarly, interest accruing on unallocated gold accounts is
recorded as a transaction in currency and deposits within reserve
assets by the monetary authority. If national practice is to include
such interest under monetary gold, the amount of interest accruing
is reclassified in the other changes in assets account.
(^12) Sometimes known as gold deposits or gold loans.
(^13) If the securities received as collateral are repoed out for cash,
a repo transaction should be reported, as discussed below under
“securities.”
(^14) If the liability is to a resident, the liability is not in the balance of
payments or IIP, but it is reported under repo loans in other foreign
currency liabilities (see Table V in Appendix 9).
(^15) If the foreign currency received from a nonresident is a claim on
a resident entity, the corresponding entry to the loan liability to the
nonresident is a reduction in currency and deposit liabilities of the
resident entity, as the transaction reduces the claim of the nonresi-
dent on the resident entity.
gold accounts included in reserve assets and out on
swap (see paragraphs 7.58–7.59) for cash collateral is
identified in the IIP to facilitate an assessment of the
level of reserves adjusted for the swap activities.
6.83 Any unallocated gold account liabilities of
resident entities to nonresident monetary authorities
are to be classified as other investment, currency and
deposits.
6.84 SDR holdings are reserve assets created by the
IMF and are equivalent to liquid balances in convertible
currencies in nearly every respect. Further information
on SDRs is provided in paragraphs 5.34–5.35.
6.85 Reserve position in the IMF is the sum of
(a) the “reserve tranche,” that is, the foreign currency
(including SDRs) amounts that a member country may
draw from the IMF at short notice;^16 and (b) any indebt-
edness of the IMF (under a loan agreement) in the
General Resources Account that is readily available to
the member country, including the reporting country’s
lending to the IMF under the General Arrangements
to Borrow (GAB) and the New Arrangements to Bor-
row (NAB). While a member country must present
a declaration of balance of payments–related need to
make a purchase in the reserve tranche (reduction in
reserve position), the IMF does not challenge a mem-
ber’s request for reserve tranche purchases. Convertible
currencies from a reserve tranche purchase may be
made available within days.
6.86 Deposits refer to those available on demand;
deposits with a fixed term that are redeemable on
demand or at very short notice without unduly affect-
ing the value of the deposit can be included. Deposits
included in reserve assets are those held in foreign
central banks, the BIS, and other nonresident deposit-
taking corporations, and deposit agreements with IMF
Trust Accounts that are readily callable to meet a
balance of payments financing need. Because short-
term loans provided by the monetary authorities to
other central banks, the BIS, and other deposit-tak-
ing corporations are much like deposits, it is difficult
(^16) Reserve-tranche positions in the IMF are liquid claims of mem-
bers on the IMF that arise not only from the reserve asset payments
for quota subscriptions but also from the sale by the IMF of their
currencies to meet the demand for use of IMF resources by other
members in need of balance of payments support. Repayments of
IMF resources in these currencies reduce the liquid claim of the
member whose currency was supplied. In Table A9-I-1 in Appendix
9 on currency composition, the reserve tranche positions in the IMF
should be classified in the “SDR basket.” The domestic currency
component of the quota is considered in economic terms to be of a
contingent nature and so is not classified as an asset or liability in
the international accounts.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

in practice to distinguish the two. For this reason,
by convention, and consistent with the treatment of
interbank positions (see paragraph 5.42), the report-
ing of deposits in reserve assets should include short-
term foreign currency loans that are redeemable upon
demand, made by the monetary authorities to these
nonresident deposit-taking corporations. Short-term
foreign currency loans that are available on demand
without unduly affecting the value of the asset, and
made by the monetary authorities to nonresident non-
deposit-taking corporations, and long-term loans to
IMF Trust Accounts that are readily repayable to meet
a balance of payments financing need can qualify as
reserve assets (“other claims”). But other long-term
loans by the monetary authorities to nonresidents not
readily available to meet balance of payments financ-
ing needs are not reserve assets.

6.87 Securities include liquid and marketable equity
and debt securities issued by nonresidents; long-term
securities (such as 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds) are
included. Unlisted securities (i.e., securities not listed
for public trading) are, in principle, excluded unless the
securities are liquid.

6.88 Securities that have been transferred under
repurchase agreements, or similar agreements by the
monetary authorities for cash collateral are assets of the
original authorities and are either (a) included as reserve
assets of the original owner with the loan generated
reported as a reserve-related liability (a memorandum
item) if a liability is to a nonresident,^17 or (b) excluded
from reserve assets and reclassified as portfolio invest-
ment assets. In either case, any loan liability to a non-
resident is recorded within “other investment,” with the
foreign currency received, provided it is a claim on a
nonresident, and is recorded as an increase in currency
and deposits within reserve assets. The value of securi-
ties included in reserve assets and out on repo (or similar
arrangements, see paragraph 7.58) for cash collateral is
identified in the IIP to facilitate an assessment of the
level of reserves adjusted for the repo activities.

6.89 In the case of reverse repos, the funds provided
to the counterparty should be recorded as a decrease
in currency and deposits within reserve assets, but if
the claim (i.e., repo asset) is liquid and available upon
demand to the monetary authorities, then it is considered
part of the reserve assets in “other claims” (or “deposits”
if classified in national measures of broad money).

(^17) If the liability is to a resident, the liability is not in the balance of
payments or IIP, but it is reported under repo loans in other foreign
currency liabilities (see Table V in Appendix 9).
6.90 When securities are lent or borrowed in
exchange for other securities and no cash is exchanged,
no transaction should be reported. Securities lent are
the assets of the original authorities, and securities col-
lateral received are not included as reserve assets of the
receiving monetary authorities.
6.91 Financial derivatives are recorded in reserve
assets only if the derivatives pertain to the manage-
ment of reserve assets, are integral to the valuation
of such assets, and are under the effective control of
the monetary authorities. Because they pertain to the
management of assets, these transactions and positions
are recorded on a net basis (assets less liabilities) at
market value.
6.92 Other claims include loans to nonresident
non-deposit-taking corporations, long-term loans to an
IMF Trust Account that are readily repayable to meet
a balance of payments financing need (see paragraph
6.86), loans arising from a reverse repo (unless classi-
fied as deposits) (paragraph 6.89), and other financial
assets not included previously but that are foreign cur-
rency assets that are available for immediate use (such
as nonnegotiable investment fund shares or units as
described in paragraph 6.101).
h. Selected cases
Special purpose government funds
6.93 Some governments create special purpose gov-
ernment funds, usually called sovereign wealth funds
(SWFs). Created and owned by the general government
for macroeconomic purposes, SWFs hold, manage, or
administer assets to achieve financial objectives, and
employ a set of investment strategies which include
investing in foreign financial assets. The funds are
commonly established out of balance of payments
surpluses, official foreign currency operations, the
proceeds of privatizations, fiscal surpluses, and/or
receipts resulting from commodity exports. The estab-
lishment of a special purpose government fund raises
the issue of whether or not the external assets held in
the fund should be included in reserve assets.
6.94 A key determination is whether some legal
or administrative guidance results in the assets being
encumbered in a way that precludes their ready avail-
ability to the monetary authorities.
6.95 If the special purpose government fund’s exter-
nal assets are on the books of the central bank, or an
agency of the central government, that allows the mon-
etary authorities control over the disposition of funds,
Chapter 6 g Functional Categories

then the presumption is that the assets are reserve assets
(provided all other criteria for being a reserve asset are
met). On the other hand, if the funds are held in a long-
term fund with a separate legal identity, the presump-
tion is that they should not be included in reserve assets,
not least because the ready availability criterion is less
likely to be met.

6.96 In some cases, while assets are invested in
a separate investment corporation, there may be an
agreement that such assets can be readily called back if
needed. In other cases, funds could be withdrawn dur-
ing the annual budgetary process.

6.97 Any final determination of whether an asset can
be classified as a reserve asset or not, depends on an
examination of the circumstances: namely, is the asset
readily available to the monetary authorities and is there
a liquid claim of a resident entity on a nonresident in
foreign currency? But in the absence of legal or adminis-
trative impediments, and given the fungibility of assets,
even assets that had been earmarked as part of a special
purpose government fund—but that could be used to meet
balance of payments financing needs and other related
purposes—are reserve assets (subject to the other criteria
being met, including, importantly, the control of the mon-
etary authorities over the disposition of the funds).

6.98 Assets held in special purpose government
funds that meet the definition of reserve assets are
classified within reserve assets depending on their
nature. So, if the special purpose government funds
hold deposits, securities, and other reserve assets, these
are classified as such within reserve assets. Assets held
in a resident special purpose government fund that are
claims on nonresidents but do not meet the criteria to be
classified as reserve assets are classified in the finan-
cial account and IIP under the appropriate instrument
and functional category. If special purpose government
funds own direct investment equity and debt securities
that could be classified in either direct investment or
reserves assets, as general guidance, in the hierarchy of
the balance of payments and IIP between direct invest-
ment and reserve assets, the equity securities should be
classified as direct investment ahead of reserve assets,
and debt securities should be classified as reserve assets
ahead of direct investment.

Pooled assets
6.99 As a means of reserve assets management,
monetary authorities from different economies might
cooperatively invest through an asset pool. Such pooled
asset arrangements are collective investment schemes

under which funds provided by participants are held in
an investment vehicle (usually nonresident of the par-
ticipants’ economies) that conducts investments. The
participants have a claim on the collective investment
scheme. Some pooled asset arrangements may have
features that constrain the use of the claim as a reserve
asset. To determine whether the claim on the pooled
asset arrangement meets the definition of reserve
assets, as with special purpose government funds, an
examination of the legal and institutional framework of
the arrangement is needed.
6.100 As with other reserve assets, the claim on the
asset pool needs to be readily available to the mon-
etary authorities and to be a liquid claim in foreign cur-
rency on nonresidents. In addition, other factors should
be considered in determining whether the claim is a
reserve asset. These include the following:
The ability to use pooled assets to raise external
liquidity in foreign currency. Even if the claim
is in foreign currency, a high concentration of the
underlying assets in claims on the domestic econ-
omy that constrains the ability of that economy
to generate external liquidity or that results in the
foreign currency value of the instrument being sig-
nificantly affected in a time of crisis (such as a
high concentration in domestic currency assets)
would cause considerable doubt as to whether the
instrument could be included in reserve assets.
Whether the assets are truly foreign currency
claims. An asset pool might be structured such
that, while the assets are denominated in foreign
currency, the monetary authority has a de facto
claim in the domestic currency. In this instance,
it is inappropriate to classify the asset as a reserve
asset for the reasons described in paragraph 6.74.
6.101 Pooled assets are classified within reserve
assets depending on their nature. For instance, if the
participant can readily transact in these claims only
by selling its claim back to the investment vehicle, the
claim might need to be classified as a nonnegotiable
investment fund share (an “other claim”). Pooled assets
that are claims on nonresidents but that do not meet
the criteria to be classified as reserve assets are classi-
fied in the financial account according to their nature
(most probably an equity asset) under the appropriate
functional category.
Central bank swap arrangements
6.102 Assets created under reciprocal facilities (swap
arrangements) for the temporary exchange of deposits
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

between the central banks of two economies warrant
mention. Deposits (in foreign exchange) acquired by
the central bank initiating the arrangement are treated
as reserve assets because the exchange provides the
central bank with assets that can be used to meet the
economy’s balance of payments financing needs and
other related purposes. Reciprocal deposits acquired
by the partner central bank also are considered reserve
assets, as long as they meet the general criteria for being
reserve assets, if they are denominated and settled in a
convertible currency.

6.103 Reciprocal currency arrangements between
central banks may also take the form of a securi-
ties repurchase agreement. In this case, one central
bank transfers securities (sometimes denominated
in its domestic currency) to another central bank in
exchange for foreign currency, with the transactions
later reversed, typically three months in the future.
Such transactions should be treated as collateralized
loans, with the central bank that initiated the trans-
action paying corresponding interest on the foreign
currency received. The cash-taking central bank can
therefore include the foreign currency received in its
reserve assets if the criteria for reserve assets are met.
The cash-providing central bank should not include
the securities received as collateral in its reserve assets
as the securities are treated as not having changed
economic ownership (see paragraph 5.54). See also
paragraph 6.90 on securities lending or borrowing
transactions in reserve assets.

6.104 When a central bank acquires or disposes of
a liquid foreign currency claim on a nonresident from
a domestic bank (e.g., through an exchange of foreign
and domestic currency deposits, a change in reserve
requirements on foreign currency deposits, or other
domestic transactions that increase or change the com-
position of reserve assets), this is recorded through the
other changes in volume account. It is not recorded in
the balance of payments, however, given that the trans-
action is between two residents (see paragraph 3.6).

i. Foreign assets that do not qualify as
reserve assets

6.105 Lines of credit that could be drawn on and for-
eign exchange resources that could be obtained under
swap agreements are not reserve assets because they do
not constitute existing claims. Real estate owned by the
monetary authorities is not to be included in reserve
assets because real estate is not considered a liquid asset.
Silver bullion, diamonds, and other precious metal and

stones are not included in reserve assets because they
are considered goods and not financial assets.
6.106 Capital subscriptions to international organi-
zations that are not readily available to the monetary
authorities do not meet the definition of reserve assets.
These subscriptions are included in other investment,
unless they are in the form of securities, in which case
they are classified as portfolio investment.
6.107 Pledged assets are typically not readily avail-
able. Those pledged assets that are encumbered and
therefore are not readily available should be excluded
from reserve assets. Encumbered assets are distinguished
from reserve assets that are pledged under securities
lending arrangements and repurchase agreements.
6.108 An example of pledged assets is collateral
used for third-party loans and third-party payments. If
these assets are encumbered, they should be excluded
from reserve assets. However, assets may be pledged
as collateral to provide guarantees in the event of
default by another entity, or for lines of credit, and
may not be encumbered until events occur to trigger
the pledge. Such assets can be included in reserve
assets until encumbered. Other examples of pledged
assets that are to be excluded from reserve assets
include (a) assets pledged by the monetary authorities
to investors as a condition for the investors to invest
in securities issued by domestic entities (such as cen-
tral government agencies), if such pledged assets are
considered encumbered; and (b) assets lent by the
monetary authorities to a third party that are not avail-
able until maturity.
6.109 The pledged assets should be excluded only to
the extent of the value of the pledge; in other words, if
the pledge is valued at 100, the maximum amount to be
excluded from reserve assets is 100.
6.110 In some circumstances, assets held as reserve
assets may be “frozen,” such as by a foreign govern-
ment within whose jurisdiction the assets are located,
restricting their availability. In such circumstances, the
reserve assets that are affected are to be reclassified to
the relevant functional category, such as “other invest-
ment” if bank deposits are “frozen.”
6.111 Foreign currency claims that are transferred
to the monetary authorities by other institutional units
in the reporting economy just prior to certain account-
ing or reporting dates, with accompanying reversals
of such transfers soon after those dates (commonly
known as “window dressing”), should not be counted
as reserve assets.
Chapter 6 g Functional Categories
6.112 Net creditor positions in regional payments
arrangements that involve reciprocal lines of credit—a
characteristic of loan arrangements (see paragraph
5.51) —are classified as loans in other investment^18 and
are not included in reserve assets, except in circumstances
in which they are considered readily available to the mon-
etary authorities to meet a balance of payments need
and other related purposes. Net asset balances in bilat-
eral payments agreements have much in common with
other types of tied loans that authorities make to stimulate
exports, provide aid, or further other aspects of govern-
ment policy. Such bilateral payments agreement balances
are therefore conventionally excluded from reserve assets.
Also, owing to their nature, working balances of govern-
ment agencies are not included in reserve assets.

j. Other issues

6.113 Assets owned by the monetary authorities that
do not meet the criteria to be classified as reserve assets
are classified in the financial account under the appro-
priate instrument and functional category.

6.114 Currency unions and economies that adopt
another currency (such as dollarization and euroiza-
tion) raise specific issues for the concept of reserve
assets. These issues are discussed in Appendix 3.

2. Reserve-related liabilities

6.115 Reserve-related liabilities are defined as
foreign currency liabilities of the monetary authori-
ties that can be considered as direct claims by
nonresidents on the reserve assets of an economy.
Though not identified as such in the standard compo-
nents of the balance of payments and IIP, where they
are included in other categories (notably portfolio

(^18) Net debtor positions in such arrangements are also classified
as loans.
and other investment), reserve-related liabilities are
important to monitor. Reserve-related liabilities can
be presented by instrument and maturity (see Appen-
dix 9, Table V). Short-term reserve-related liabilities
on a remaining maturity basis are a memorandum
item to the IIP (as shown in Box 6.5). Some econo-
mies may choose to present the full table of foreign
currency assets and liabilities in Appendix 9, Table
V, separately identifying the short-term reserve-
related liabilities.
6.116 The value of the SDR allocation and loans
from the IMF to monetary authorities are included
in reserve-related liabilities. Other liabilities covered
include:

Foreign currency loan and deposit liabilities of
the monetary authorities to nonresidents, includ-
ing those arising from foreign currency swaps with
other central banks, loans from BIS, and from
other deposit-takers;
Foreign currency loan liabilities to nonresidents
associated with securities that the monetary
authorities have repoed out;
Foreign currency securities issued by the monetary
authorities and owed to nonresidents; and
Other foreign currency liabilities to nonresidents,
including foreign currency accounts payable and
financial derivatives—recorded on a net basis (lia-
bilities less assets) —settled in foreign currency
and associated with, but not within the definition
of, reserve assets (see paragraph 6.91). Such finan-
cial derivatives could include those that are not
sufficiently liquid or are not integral to the valua-
tion of reserves assets.
Liabilities to residents and liabilities that are both
denominated and settled in domestic currency are not
included.

7.1 The international investment position (IIP) is a
statistical statement that shows at a point in time the
value and composition of

(a) financial assets of residents of an economy that
are claims on nonresidents and gold bullion held
as reserve assets, and
(b) liabilities of residents of an economy to non-
residents.
The difference between an economy’s external finan-
cial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which
may be positive or negative.

7. 2 The IIP is a subset of the national balance sheet.
The net IIP plus the value of nonfinancial assets equals
the net worth of the economy, which is the balancing
item of the national balance sheet. The classification of
nonfinancial assets is shown in Table 5.1 and linked to
corresponding income items in Table 5.2.
7. 3 The IIP relates to a point in time, usually at the
beginning of the period (opening value) or end of the
period (closing value).
7. 4 This chapter explains the coverage, presentation,
classification, timing, and valuation issues for the IIP,
and its relationship to transactions accounts and other
changes in assets and liabilities account.
7. 5 The content of the IIP can be presented in sev-
eral different ways. Table 7.1 shows an overview of
the structure and components of the IIP by functional
category and broad financial instruments. This presen-

tation emphasizes how changes in the IIP result from
financial account transactions (discussed in Chapter
8) and other changes in financial assets and liabilities
(discussed in Chapter 9) during a period.
7.6 Table 7.2 provides another presentation that
emphasizes the breakdown of the IIP by institutional
sector and functional category. Institutional sectors in
the IIP refer to the resident sector, not the counterpart
sector (i.e., the sector of the domestic holder or lender
for assets, and the sector of the domestic issuer or bor-
rower for liabilities).
Additional detail
7.7 This edition of the Manual reflects the increasing
emphasis on the IIP in international accounts compila-
tion and analysis. There has been growing recognition
of the role of balance sheet analysis in understand-
ing sustainability and vulnerability, including currency
mismatches, the implications of sector and interest
rate composition of debt, and the effect of the matu-
rity structure on liquidity. IIP data are useful for other
purposes, such as measuring rates of return, analyzing
economic structure, and studying the relationship to
domestic sources of financing.
7. 8 Consequently, a currency composition and
remaining maturity analysis of the IIP are encouraged
as additional information. To meet this goal, memoran-
dum and supplementary tables have been introduced in
Appendix 9, and are shown after the standard compo-
nents. These tables provide a presentation of currency
composition of assets and liabilities by sector with a
distribution by principal foreign currencies, including
the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, and others, together with a
breakdown by original maturity. The tables also pro-
vide information on the remaining maturity of long-
term debt liabilities, with a breakdown by sector. These
tables are consistent with the standard components of
the IIP and with the presentation adopted in External
Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users.

Direct Investment.
These guides are based on the same core principles,
with additional elements including more detail, alter-
native valuations, discussion of implementation issues,
and additional items, such as contingencies, guaran-
tees, and other off-balance-sheet items.

1. Definition of economic assets

Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 10, The Capital Account.

7.10 The IIP covers the subset of financial assets
and liabilities that have an international character. In
most cases, the international character of a financial
asset or liability arises because, of the two parties, one
is a resident and the other is nonresident. The gold bul-
lion component of monetary gold is the only case of a
financial asset with no counterpart liability. The scope

and definitions of different types of economic assets is
given in paragraphs 5.2–5.14.
7.11 The concept of ownership of assets in the IIP
is based on economic ownership, as defined in para-
graph 3.41. The economic owner is the party who
has the risks and rewards of holding the asset. Own-
ership of financial assets can be complex in some
legal arrangements, for example, the lessor under a
financial lease has the legal title, while the lessee
has most of the risks and benefits of ownership. (For
further details on financial leases, see paragraphs
5.56–5.59 and 7.57.)
2. Classification
7.12 Possible dimensions for the classification of the
IIP are:
(a) Functional category—direct investment, port-
folio investment, financial derivatives (other
than reserves) and ESOs, other investment, and
reserve assets, as defined in Chapter 6;
(b) Financial instrument—according to the broad
groupings (equity and investment fund shares,
debt instruments, and other financial assets and

liabilities) or the full breakdown, as defined in
Chapter 5;
(c) Institutional sector of resident party—at least,
central bank, deposit-taking corporations except
the central bank, general government, and other
sectors; other sectors is split between other
financial corporations and the remaining non-
financial subsectors (nonfinancial corporations,
households, and NPISHs), as defined in Chap-
ter 4, Section D. Additional subsectoring of the
financial and nonfinancial sectors may be under-
taken when analytically relevant;
(d) Maturity (in the case of debt instruments) —short-
term or long-term, by original and remaining
maturity, as defined in paragraphs 5.103–5.105;
(e) Currency—domestic or foreign currency, as
defined in paragraphs 3.95–3.97 for debt and
3.100 for equity; and (in the case of financial
derivatives) to receive or pay foreign currency,
as defined in paragraph 5.108; and
(f) Interest rate structure (in the case of debt instru-
ments) —variable- or fixed-rate, as defined in
paragraphs 5.109–5.114.
Sector, maturity, and currency are relevant to studies of
sustainability, vulnerability, and exposure to exchange
rate changes (after taking into account any hedging).
The remaining maturity is important to the debtor, but
it is less relevant for the creditor with liquid instru-
ments, in that the assets can be sold before maturity.
In addition to the institutional sector of the resident
party, as in (c), the institutional sector of nonresident
counterparty may also be of interest in some cases (e.g.,
governments may wish to distinguish between other
governments, international organizations, and other
sources of their borrowing).

7.13 A consistent classification should be used as far
as possible for IIP and other related accounts. The stock
of assets and liabilities, financial account transactions,
and other changes in financial assets and liabilities all
relate to the same instruments, so a consistent clas-
sification is necessary for a comprehensive analysis
of relationships between them. Similarly, a consistent
level of detail for income (and possibly holding gains
or losses, for some purposes) and positions allows the
estimation of rates of return. Although the international
accounts functional classification of assets and liabili-
ties is not used in the SNA or financial statistics, the
instrument and institutional sector classifications are
the same. The inclusion of instrument and sector detail
in IIP data facilitates understanding and checking the

linkages with other data sets such as monetary and
financial statistics.
B. Direct Investment
7.14 Direct investment is defined in paragraphs
6.8–6.24. Other aspects of direct investment are cov-
ered in paragraphs 6.25–6.41. The directional principle
presentation of direct investment can be used in the IIP
on a supplementary basis, as discussed in paragraphs
6.42–6.45 and Box 6.4. Other specific issues concern-
ing direct investment in the IIP are discussed in the
following paragraphs.
1. Valuation of unlisted and other equity
References:
OECD, OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct
Investment , fourth edition.
IMF, Coordinated Direct Investment Survey Guide.
7.15 Shares and other equity can be readily valued
at their current prices when they are regularly traded on
stock exchanges or other financial markets. However,
there may be no observable market prices for positions
in equity not listed on a stock exchange (i.e., items (b)
and (c) in paragraph 5.24). This situation often arises for
direct investment enterprises, private equity, equity in
unlisted and delisted companies, listed but illiquid com-
panies, joint ventures, and unincorporated enterprises.
7.16 When actual market values are not available, an
estimate is required. Alternative methods of approxi-
mating market value of shareholders’ equity in a direct
investment enterprise include the following:^1
(a) Recent transaction price. Unlisted instruments
may trade from time to time, and recent prices,
within the past year, at which they were traded
may be used. Recent prices are a good indica-
tor of current market values to the extent that
conditions are unchanged. This method can
be used as long as there has been no mate-
rial change in the corporation’s position since
the transaction date. Recent transaction prices
become increasingly misleading as time passes
and conditions change.

(^1) These are not ranked according to preference, and each would
need to be assessed according to the circumstances and the plausi-
bility of results.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

(b) Net asset value. Appraisals of untraded equity
may be conducted by knowledgeable manage-
ment or directors of the enterprise, or provided
by independent auditors to obtain total assets
at current value less total liabilities (excluding
equity) at market value. Valuations should be
recent (within the past year) and should prefer-
ably include intangible assets.
(c) Present value and price-to-earnings ratios. The
present value of unlisted equity can be estimated
by discounting the forecast future profits. At its
simplest, this method can be approximated by
applying a market or industry price-to-earnings
ratio to the (smoothed) recent past earnings of
the unlisted enterprise to calculate a price.^2 This
method is most appropriate in which there is a
paucity of balance sheet information but earn-
ings data are more readily available.
(d) Market capitalization method. Book values
reported by enterprises can be adjusted at an
aggregate level by the statistical compiler. For
untraded equity, information on “own funds at
book value” (see paragraph 7.16(e)) can be col-
lected from enterprises, and then adjusted with
ratios based on suitable price indicators, such as
the ratio of market capitalization to book value
for listed companies in the same economy with
similar operations. Alternatively, assets that
enterprises carry at cost (such as land, plant,
equipment, and inventories) can be revalued to
current period prices using suitable asset price
indices.
(e) Own funds at book value. This method for valuing
equity uses the value of the enterprise recorded
in the books of the direct investment enterprise,
as the sum of (a) paid-up capital (excluding
any shares on issue that the enterprise holds in
itself and including share premium accounts);
(b) all types of reserves identified as equity in
the enterprise’s balance sheet (including invest-
ment grants when accounting guidelines con-
sider them company reserves); (c) cumulated
reinvested earnings; and (d) holding gains or
losses included in own funds in the accounts,
whether as revaluation reserves or profits or
losses. The more frequent the revaluation of
(^2) The earnings measure and earnings in the price-to-earnings ratio
should be defined in the same way. It is preferable that measures of
earnings and ratios exclude one-off factors, such as asset sales, as
such factors could distort the calculation.
assets and liabilities, the closer the approxima-
tion to market values. Data that are not revalued
for several years may be a poor reflection of
market values.
(f) Apportioning global value. The current market
value of the global enterprise group can be based
on the market price of its shares on the exchange on
which its equity is traded, if it is a listed company.
Where an appropriate indicator may be identified
(e.g., sales, net income, assets, or employment), the
global value may be apportioned to each economy
in which it has direct investment enterprises, on
the basis of that indicator, by making the assump-
tion that the ratio of net market value to sales,
net income, assets, or employment is a constant
throughout the transnational enterprise group.
(Each indicator could yield significantly different
results from the others.)
7.17 In cases in which none of the above meth-
ods are feasible, less suitable data may need to be
used as data inputs. For example, cumulated flows
or a previous balance sheet adjusted by subsequent
flows may be the only sources available. Because
these sources use the prices of previous periods,
they should be adjusted for subsequent price devel-
opments, for example, by using aggregate share price
or asset price indexes and by taking into account
exchange rate movements, where relevant. The use
of unadjusted summing of past transactions is not
recommended. Equity represents owners’ funds.
The means through which equity can be generated
may take various forms, such as share issues, equity
injections without any commensurate issue of shares
(sometimes called “contributed surplus” or “capital
contributions”), share premiums, accumulated rein-
vested earnings, or revaluation. Although these cat-
egories should be taken into account when cumulated
flows are used to measure the value of equity, the
different categories are all components of equity and
need not be identified separately.
7.18 If the current market price is not directly
observable, the decision about the methods to adopt
should take into account the availability of information
as well as judgments as to which available method best
approximates market values. Different methods may
be suitable for different circumstances and a standard
ranking of the alternative methods is not proposed for
valuing instruments when current market prices are not
directly observable. Compilers should be transparent
and should state clearly the method(s) used. Methods
Chapter 7 g International Investment Position

for valuation of direct investment equity positions are
discussed in more detail in the OECD Benchmark Defi-
nition of Foreign Direct Investment. These methods
may also be useful for valuation of other unlisted equity
securities and other equity.

7.19 The value of a direct investment enterprise’s
nonequity liabilities may exceed its assets—this situ-
ation can occur most commonly in the early or final
stages of its existence.

2. Entities that borrow on behalf of
their affiliates

Reference:

OECD, OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct
Investment , fourth edition.

7. 2 0 An entity resident in one economy may bor-
row funds on behalf of affiliated enterprises in one
or more other economies. The affiliates may include
holding companies, parent companies, direct invest-
ment enterprises, and fellow enterprises. Examples
include SPEs, sometimes called conduits, which may
be used to undertake the borrowing, or an entity with
substantial activities of its own may do the borrowing.
In these cases, the liability is often guaranteed by the
parent or a fellow enterprise. Alternatively, the affili-
ated enterprise may commit future revenue streams.
Regulatory or taxation benefits may be factors behind
such arrangements. In these cases, the creditor records
a claim on the entity that directly undertakes the bor-
rowing. That is, the creditor does not show its claim
as being on the enterprise that ultimately receives the
funds or makes the guarantee.
7. 21 When funds raised are passed on by the bor-
rowing entity to an affiliated enterprise, the initial bor-
rowing entity has a claim on the affiliated enterprise.
This arrangement can be assumed to give rise to a
loan, unless there is evidence that it is a debt security
or equity. This borrowing can arise for pass-through
funds (discussed in paragraphs 6.33–6.34), conduits
(paragraph 4.86), and SPEs and similar legal structures
(paragraph 4.87). In many cases, such investment is
reverse investment or investment between fellow enter-
prises, as discussed in paragraphs 6.39–6.41 and 6.43,
respectively.
7. 22 Special rules apply to an entity owned or con-
trolled by general government when that entity is resi-
dent in another territory and is used for fiscal purposes.
These rules are discussed in paragraphs 8.24–8.26.
**3. Quasi-corporations

23** The identification of institutional units for
branches, notional resident units for ownership of land
and natural resources, some joint ventures, and prepara-
tory operations prior to incorporation and other quasi-
corporations is discussed in paragraphs 4.26–4.49. The
effect of the identification of such institutional units is
that owners are shown as having a claim on the institu-
tional unit, rather than as directly owning the various
individual assets.
7. 2 4 Owners’ claims on quasi-corporations that are
resident in other economies are usually classified as
direct investment. In the rare cases in which the propor-
tion of equity in land or a joint venture is less than 10
percent, the claim is classified as other investment—
other equity.
7. 25 Equity in quasi-corporations should be valued
as equal to the market value of the quasi-corpora-
tions’ assets less the market value of liabilities other
than equity to both residents and nonresidents. (This
method would mean that quasi-corporations have no
residual net worth.) Alternatively, equity in quasi-cor-
porations may be valued using the same methods as
used for direct investment equity, discussed in para-
g r a p h s 7.16 –7.17.
C. Portfolio Investment
1. Equity with dividends declared payable but
not yet paid
7. 26 In market quotations, dividends declared pay-
able but not yet paid are taken into account in the
share price. After the point of time when ownership
of shares is determined for the purposes of payment of
dividends, the shares go “ex dividend.” (Ex dividend
is the point at which the shares no longer carry the
right to the most recently declared dividend; so the
dividend becomes separated from the share and the
price falls to reflect that.) After that time, dividends
declared should be included in accounts receivable/
payable until payment is made.
2. Debt instruments with accrued interest
7. 27 Accrued interest not yet paid on debt securi-
ties should be included in the outstanding amount of
the financial asset or liability. Accrued interest not
yet paid includes interest that has accrued and that
is not yet due for payment or that is due for payment

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

but in arrears. Accrued interest not yet paid should
not be reported separately (such as in other accounts
receivable/payable). In market quotations, a value
including interest that has accrued but is not yet
payable is called the “dirty price” and is suitable for
valuation of items in the IIP (provided interest due
and not yet paid is also included). In contrast, the
“clean price” requires accrued interest not yet paid
to be added for use in the IIP. Methods of calculating
the accrual of interest are discussed in paragraphs
11.48 –11.76.

3. Short positions
7. 2 8 Short positions occur when an institutional
unit sells securities for which it is not the economic
owner. For example, a security subject to a repurchase
agreement may be on-sold by the security-receiving
party (see paragraphs 5.52–5.54 on repurchase agree-
ments). Delivery to the purchaser is made through
the use of a borrowed security. The party with the
short position records a negative value for the hold-
ing of the asset. The short position is shown as a
negative asset, rather than a liability. (Short positions
have been included on the research agenda for further
work; see paragraph 1.43.)
4. Unlisted debt and equity securities
7. 29 Positions in unlisted portfolio investment
equity securities without an observable market price
may be valued using methods discussed in paragraphs
7.16–7.17 for direct investment equity. Some listed
debt securities also may have no quoted prices, for
example, if the market is illiquid or the security ceases
trading due to suspension, default, or bankruptcy. A
market price can be estimated for such debt securi-
ties by discounting future cash flows using a discount
rate that takes into account the risk of default (present
value approach).
5. Debt securities at nominal values
7. 3 0 Whereas the basic valuation method for debt
securities is the market value, the nominal value is
encouraged as a supplementary item. External Debt
Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users recom-
mends that both valuations be used. The nominal
value of debt securities is a useful measure of value
from the viewpoint of the debtor, because at any
moment, it is the amount that the debtor owes to the
creditors.
6. Zero-coupon and deep-discount bonds
7. 31 A zero-coupon bond has a single payment at matu-
rity and no coupon payments. The bond is sold at a dis-
count from face (or par) value, and at maturity, an amount
equal to face value is repaid. The difference between the
discounted issue price and the face value reflects the
market rate of interest at the time of issue—the longer the
maturity of the bond and the higher the market interest
rate, the greater the discount against the face value. The
accrual of interest on zero-coupon bonds is discussed in
paragraph 11.55 and is illustrated in Box 11.2.
7. 32 A deep-discount bond is a bond that has a low
coupon compared with the market rate of interest, so
that it is issued at a considerable discount to face value.
Like the zero-coupon bond, the difference between the
issue price and face value accrues as interest over the life
of the bond, and the market value of the bond increases
as the interest accrues. The accrual of interest on deep-
discount bonds is discussed in paragraph 11.56.

D. Financial Derivatives (Other than Reserves) and Employee Stock Options
7. 33 Financial derivatives and ESOs are valued at
market prices prevailing on balance sheet recording
dates. If market price data are unavailable, other fair
value methods (such as option models or present val-
ues) may be used to value them. Compilers are gener-
ally constrained to use the parties’ own accounts.
7. 3 4 For an option (including warrants), the
market value recorded is the current value of the
option—that is, the prevailing market price. In the
absence of a prevailing market price, the estimated
cost of buying out the rights of the option holder
should be used. The counterpart liability is attribut-
able, by convention, to the writer of the option and
is valued at the current cost of buying out the rights
of the option holder. For a warrant, the counterpart
liability of the issuer is the current outlay required
to buy out the exercise rights of the holder. A for-
ward-type contract is recorded at market value; when
payments are effected, a transaction is recorded and
the change in the value of the asset and associated
liability is reflected in the position (see paragraph
5.81 for discussion of offsetability).
7. 35 A key characteristic of many derivative con-
tracts is that the counterparties make commitments
to transact, in the future and at agreed-on prices, in
underlying items. The present value (or market price)

Chapter 7 g International Investment Position
of a financial derivative is derived from the difference
between the agreed-on contract price of an underlying
item and the prevailing market price (or the market
price expected to prevail), appropriately discounted,
for that item. For options, the price depends on the
potential price volatility of the underlying instrument,
the time to maturity, interest rates, and the difference
between the strike price and the market price of the
underlying item. The value of a swap contract is derived
from the difference, appropriately discounted, between
expected gross receipts and gross payments.

7. 36 The market value of a forward-type contract can
switch from an asset position to a liability position (and
vice versa) between reporting dates. The switch is a result
of movement in the price of the underlying item(s) from
which the value of the forward-type contract is derived.
When a switch in position occurs (and there are no settle-
ment payments), the market value of the gross asset or
liability position at the close of the previous accounting
period is revalued to zero, and the gross liability or asset
position is revalued from zero to the market value at the
end of the present accounting period.
7. 37 Gross asset and gross liability data should be
compiled by summing, respectively, the values of all
individual contracts in asset positions and the values of
all individual contracts in liability positions. Financial
derivatives, by preference, should be reported sepa-
rately for both assets and liabilities, as discussed in
paragraphs 3.119 and 6.60. Notional values of financial
derivatives are presented according to the formats shown
in Appendix 9, Tables I–III. The notional value (some-
times called notional amount or nominal amount) of a
financial derivative is the amount underlying a finan-
cial derivative contract that is necessary for calculat-
ing payments or receipts on the contract. This amount
may or may not be exchanged. The notional values are
useful for analysis because they provide information
about the risk exposure and assist in understanding the
link between financial derivatives and the underlying
to which they relate.
7. 38 Cumulation of transactions should never be used
to estimate financial derivative positions. Transactions
relate largely to those in options and to settlements. Set-
tlements eliminate positions, while the value of deriva-
tives positions emerges largely from revaluation.
7. 39 ESOs are valued consistently with the cumu-
lated compensation of employees until the vesting date
(see paragraphs 11.20–11.21); thereafter, they are val-
ued at market prices (see paragraph 9.30). ESOs can be
measured from a market value of equivalent options or

according to an options-pricing model, such as Black-
Scholes. International accounting standards give guid-
ance on methods, and recording in the international
accounts normally will follow business accounts.
E. Other Investment
1. Valuation of nonnegotiable instruments

a. Nominal value
7. 4 0 Nonnegotiable instruments include loans,
deposits, and other accounts receivable/payable. The
primary valuation for positions in these instruments
is nominal value, which is defined in paragraph 3.88.
In the case of other equity included in other invest-
ment, valuation methods for unlisted direct and port-
folio investment equity may be used, as discussed in
paragraphs 7.16–7.17 and 7.25.
7. 41 Accrued interest not yet paid should be included
in the outstanding amount of the financial asset or liabil-
ity, rather than being classified separately (such as in
other accounts receivable/payable). Accrued interest not
yet paid also includes FISIM accrued and not yet paid.
7. 42 Nominal values are not adjusted for expected
losses or for changes in interest rates. The market value
may differ from the nominal value primarily due to
changes in market interest rates and the possibility
that some liabilities may not be repaid. The possible
divergence between nominal and market values arises
for loans, but it can also arise for deposits and other
accounts receivable/payable.
7. 43 The use of nominal values for some nonnego-
tiable instruments, instead of market-equivalent values, in
the IIP is partly influenced by pragmatic concerns about
data availability and also by consistency in reporting by
debtors and creditors. Nominal valuation is also useful in
its own right, however, because it shows actual legal liabil-
ity and the starting point of creditor recovery behavior.
7. 4 4 The nominal value can be reduced by a write-
off, restructuring, or debt forgiveness:

Liabilities are canceled or written off, in part or
in full, by the creditor as uncollectible, usually
because of the bankruptcy or liquidation of the
debtor, as discussed in paragraphs 9.8–9.11.
In a formal debt reorganization, the old liability is
regarded as being extinguished and a new liability
created. (See Appendix 2, Debt Reorganization
and Related Transactions.)
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

b. Additional data on loans and other
nonnegotiable instruments

7. 45 While nominal value is the primary valuation
method for nonnegotiable instruments, it provides an
incomplete view of the financial position of the credi-
tor, particularly in cases in which the instruments are
impaired. Consequently, additional items are included
for loans to give additional information. The possible
items are:

(a) fair value,
(b) nonperforming loans, and
(c) loan loss (bad debt) provisions.
These items are discussed in paragraphs 7.48–7.53. Data
on debt i n a r rea rs a re d iscusse d i n pa rag raphs 5.99 –5.102.
These are alternative indicators that can be used to assess
the effect of impairment and other variations between
nominal values and market-equivalent values. Fair value
expresses a market-equivalent valuation of the position.
Nonperforming loans indicate the value of the loans that
are impaired, and loan loss (bad debt) provisions show
amounts that are deducted from the nominal value to
account for expected losses in business accounts.

7. 46 The fair value of loans is shown as a memo-
randum item for creditors. If fair value data for loans
are not available, the nominal value of nonperform-
ing loans should be provided as a memorandum item.
These memorandum items are included for assets but
not liabilities. If fair value data are available, nonper-
forming loans is a supplementary item. Data on loan
loss (or bad debt) provisions and arrears also may be
provided on a supplementary basis.
7. 47 The same issue of impairment arises for deposits
and trade credit. For example, an insolvent bank may have
closed its doors, so that its deposits may be worth less than
their nominal value, so alternative measures for deposits
and trade credit may be prepared, where relevant.

c. Fair value

Reference:

International Financial Reporting Standards , Interna-
tional Accounting Standard 39 Financial Instru-
ments: Recognition and Measurement.

7. 4 8 Fair value is defined as the amount for which
an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled,
between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s-
length transaction. That is, fair value represents a
market-equivalent value, namely, an estimate of what
could have been realized if the creditor had sold the

loan. It is the preferred indicator of the effect of loan
impairment as it represents an attempt to measure the
realizable value. The fair value of loan assets is shown
as a memorandum item for assets, where available.
7. 49 The calculation of fair value takes into account
expected loan losses. In addition, in the case of fixed-rate
loans, it takes into account changes in market interest
rates. In practice, the availability of fair value estimates
of loans is limited by business accounting practice. A
recent transaction in the loan or one of similar term,
credit risk, and so on provides a good guide to the fair
value. As the time since the transaction becomes longer
and conditions change, such transactions values become
historic prices and not market-equivalent values.

d. Nonperforming loans
7. 50 Nonperforming loans are defined as those for
which:
(a) payments of principal and interest are past due
by three months (90 days) or more, or
(b) interest payments equal to three months’ (90
days’) interest or more have been capitalized
(reinvested into the principal amount) or pay-
ment has been delayed by agreement,^3 or
(c) evidence exists to classify a loan as nonper-
forming even in the absence of a 90-day past
due payment, such as when the debtor files for
bankruptcy.^4
7. 51 Nonperforming loans are recorded at nomi-
nal value, which allows them to be compared with the
total value of loans at nominal value. The value should
include accrued interest not yet paid. Loans continue
to be included in nonperforming loans until written
off (see paragraphs 9.8–9.11), forgiven (see paragraphs
13.22–13.23), reorganized (see paragraph 9.29 and
Appendix 2), or they become performing loans.
7. 52 The three-month (or 90-day) criterion is the
time period most widely used, although other periods
are used. When the standard definition of nonperform-
ing loans is not used, other definitions based on regula-
tory frameworks are acceptable. Because identification
of nonperforming loans is a bank regulatory concept, it
may not be used widely by other creditors. The nominal
value of nonperforming loan assets is a memorandum

(^3) If the loan is rescheduled, it is classified as a new instrument (see
paragraph 7.53). Rescheduling interest arrears is not sufficient for
the loan to have been considered rescheduled, see paragraph A2.12.

graph 4.84.

item when loan assets at fair value are not available;
otherwise, it is a supplementary item.

7. 53 Information on replacement loans may be pro-
vided in addition to nonperforming loans. Replacement
loans include loans arising from rescheduling or refi-
nancing the original loan and loans provided to make
payments on the original loan. Although these loans
may be granted on “easier” than normal commercial
terms, provided the terms and conditions of the replace-
ment loan are complied with by the debtor, and subject
to national supervisory guidance, the replacement loan
is not classified as nonperforming.

e. Loan loss provisions

7. 54 Loan loss provisions, also called bad debt provi-
sions, are internal accounting entries made by creditors to
take into account possible loan losses. These provisions
may be used as an indicator of the difference between
nominal values and fair values. International accounting
standards allow for various approaches to derive these
provisions, so procedures may differ between enterprises
and between economies. Loan loss provisions may vary
from the loss of value of nonperforming loans, for exam-
ple, because there is adequate collateral for a nonper-
forming loan, or there is an expectation that a proportion
of performing loans will default later.

f. Deposits and other accounts
receivable/payable

7. 55 Positions in deposits and other accounts
receivable/payable give rise to the same issues of
nominal and fair values as loans. For example, depos-
its may be held at a bank in liquidation, or trade
credit liabilities may include those owed by insolvent
debtors. These instruments should be recorded at
their nominal value. However, if there is a significant
difference between the nominal and fair value, indi-
cators similar to those for loans should be shown as
supplementary items.

g. Metadata on indicators of impairment

7. 56 In view of the range of options concerning mea-
sures of impairment of loans and other nonnegotiable
instruments, it is particularly important that metadata
provide information on the definitions and sources
used. As accounting procedures become more widely
standardized, more prescriptive guidance may be given
in statistical manuals for the adoption of particular
indicators of impairment of loans.
**2. Financial leases

57** A financial lease is defined in paragraph 5.56.
The treatment of financial leases is designed to capture
the economic reality of the arrangements. It moves away
from the legal form by treating goods under a financial
lease as if they were purchased and owned by the user.
The financial lease is shown as a loan from the lessor
to the lessee that is used to finance the acquisition of a
fixed asset by the lessee. Financial leases affect goods,
services, income, financial transactions, and positions.
**3. Recording of positions associated with
securities repurchase agreements and other
reverse transactions
58** Reverse transactions are arrangements that
involve a change of legal ownership of securities or
gold with a commitment to repurchase the same or
similar securities or gold either on a specified date or
with open maturity. They include securities repurchase
agreements, gold swaps, securities lending, and gold
loans. The commitment to reverse the change in legal
ownership in the future at a fixed price means that the
original owner retains the risks and rewards of changes
in the price of the asset. Accordingly, there is consid-
ered to be no change of economic ownership of the
security or gold, so no transaction in that security or
gold is recorded, and ownership of the asset as shown
in the IIP is unchanged.
7. 59 A reverse transaction may be with or without
the supply of cash. If cash is supplied, as in a repur-
chase agreement (repo or securities lending with cash
collateral), and in return the other party supplies secu-
rities, the arrangement is regarded as giving rise to a
loan or deposit. (The classification of the cash supplied
is discussed in paragraphs 5.52–5.54.) Analogously to
repos, a gold swap for cash is treated as being a loan
with the gold as collateral, and there is no change in the
economic ownership of the gold.
7.60 There may be problems in attributing secu-
rities ownership when using custodians as a data
source, because custodians may not know whether
securities being held are under a repurchase agree-
ment or not.
7.61 If a party that receives securities under a reverse
transaction on-sells the securities to a third party, then
it has a short position. The treatment of short positions
is discussed in paragraph 7.28. Fees payable to one of
the parties under a reverse transaction are discussed in
paragraphs 11.67–11.68.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

4. Overnight deposits

7.62 Overnight deposits (or sweep accounts) involve
funds that are moved back and forth overnight. In some
cases, these overnight accounts are held in another
economy. The funds are returned at the beginning of
the next working day and may then be moved back at
the close of business. Positions should be measured after
funds are moved at the end of the day. The calculation of
major statistical aggregates—including external asset and
liability positions and financial transactions—can differ
substantially depending on whether they are measured
before, or after, funds are moved. By measuring posi-
tions and transactions after the funds have been moved,
consistency is ensured between the measure of interest
flows and of positions. In addition, major data users are
interested in the size and location of these stocks and
flows for risk assessment and other purposes.

5. Insurance technical reserves, pension
and annuity entitlements, and standardized
guarantees reserves

7.63 These reserves include:
(a) prepayment of premiums and reserves for out-
standing claims for nonlife insurance (both
reported claims and for claims incurred and not
reported). Equalization reserves (explained fur-
ther in paragraph 5.64(b)) for events that have
occurred are included, whereas reserves for
events that have not occurred are excluded;
(b) entitlements of beneficiaries under life insurance
policies and pension schemes; and
(c) provisions for calls under standardized guarantees.
7.6 4 Insurance technical reserves are regarded as
liabilities of the insurance companies and assets of the
policyholders and beneficiaries. For economies that are
major insurance service exporters or importers, cross-
border insurance reserves may be significant. For econo-
mies that are major sources or destinations of temporary
workers or that are sources or destinations for retirees
who change residence, life insurance and pension entitle-
ments may be important elements of the IIP. Insurance
technical reserves may be classified as direct investment
in the cases discussed in paragraph 6.27.

7.65 The nature of the pension entitlements liabilities
of the pension fund and the corresponding asset of the
beneficiaries depend on the nature of the pension plan:

(a) A defined contribution scheme is one in which
the benefits are defined exclusively in terms of
the level of the fund built up from the contri-
butions made over the employee’s working life
and the increases in value that result from the
investment of these funds by the manager of the
pension scheme. The entire risk of the scheme to
provide an adequate income in retirement is thus
borne by the employee. The liability of a defined
contribution fund, and the corresponding assets
of the beneficiaries, are equal to the current mar-
ket value of the assets of the fund, including any
claims on the employer. Defined contribution
plans are always funded.
(b) A defined benefit scheme is one in which the
benefits payable to the employee on retirement
are determined by the use of a formula, either
alone or as a minimum amount payable. The
liability of a defined benefit scheme, and the cor-
responding assets of the beneficiaries, are equal
to the present value of the promised benefits. In
defined benefit schemes, benefits to the policy-
holder are guaranteed, but the scheme may be
funded or unfunded.
7.66 The calculation of the value of pension entitle-
ments may be direct or actuarial. Obligations of unfunded
pension schemes are recognized as liabilities, based on
actuarial estimates of the accrued liability to benefi-
ciaries under the scheme. Potential payments by social
security schemes are not recognized as financial assets
or liabilities. (See paragraphs 5.66–5.67 for more detail
about pension entitlements as a financial instrument.)
7.67 Provisions for calls under standardized guar-
antees are calculated in a similar way as described for
nonlife insurance technical reserves. They are equal to
the present value of expected calls under outstanding
guarantees, net of any recoveries the guarantor expects
to receive from the defaulting parties.^5
7.68 To the extent that these reserves, entitlements,
and provisions are measured from the accounts of
insurance companies, pension schemes, and issuers
of standardized guarantees, they may need to be split
between liabilities to residents and nonresidents accord-
ing to a suitable indicator such as premiums payable.
The priority attached to the estimation of cross-border
(^5) These amounts may represent an overstatement of the assets and
liabilities. For example, financial institutions make 1,000 loans of
20 units each that are covered by standardized guarantees, of which
estimated claims are 200. The combined assets (and combined
liabilities) of all the parties involved would be shown as 20,200,
consisting of 20,000 loans and 200 in expected calls under the
guarantees, even though only a maximum of 20,000 could ever be
realized. The overstatement arises because the loans are recorded at
nominal value.
Chapter 7 g International Investment Position

proportions of insurance reserves depends on their sig-
nificance in each economy.

F. Reserves
7.69 At the appropriate reference dates, reserve
assets are valued in the main at current market
prices. Monetary gold is valued at the prevailing
market price, SDRs are valued at market rates calcu-
lated by the IMF, and deposits and loans are valued
at nominal values.

7.70 SDR holdings are a reserve asset, while the allo-
cation of SDRs to IMF members is shown as the incur-
rence of a liability by the recipient and included in other
investment. Therefore, for an economy that holds only its
original allocation, its reserve assets are increased by the
value of SDR holdings, but its net IIP is unchanged.

7.71 Reserve-related liabilities are shown as a mem-
orandum item to the IIP on a short-term (remaining
maturity) basis (see Appendix 9, Table V). They are
defined in paragraphs 6.115–6.116. A comprehensive
picture of foreign currency assets and liabilities of
monetary authorities and central government, includ-
ing positions with residents as well as nonresidents,
can be presented according to the format in Table V in
Appendix 9.

7.72 Positions with the IMF include reserve assets,
reserve-related liabilities, other investment, and
off-balance-sheet liabilities (these are elaborated in
Annex 7.1).

7.73 Some governments have large special pur-
pose government funds—usually known as sovereign
wealth funds—as discussed in paragraphs 6.93–6.98.
Some of these assets may be included in reserve
assets or possibly in other functional categories.
Where such a fund is significant, the special pur-
pose government fund’s foreign assets not included
in reserve assets can be shown separately as supple-
mentary items.

G. Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities
7.74 As noted in paragraphs 5.10–5.14, some actual
and potential obligations are not recognized as liabilities
in the IIP. Examples include potential liabilities under
one-off guarantees, unfulfilled loan commitments, and
other explicit contingent liabilities (for further discus-
sion, see Chapter 9, Contingent Liabilities, of External
Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users ). If such

obligations to nonresidents are significant, compilers
should provide supplementary data in terms of the maxi-
mum exposure loss by type of contingent liability.
Annex 7.1 Positions and Transactions with the IMF
Quotas
7.75 IMF member countries are assigned a quota on
joining the IMF. The subscription of the quota consists
of two components:
(a) Foreign exchange component. A member is
required to pay 25 percent of its quota in SDRs
or in foreign currencies acceptable to the IMF.
This 25 percent portion is a component of the
member’s reserve assets. In the balance of pay-
ments, subscribing this portion is shown as a
transaction involving a reduction in other reserve
assets (credit) offset by an increase in the reserve
tranche position in the IMF (debit).
(b) Domestic currency component. The other 75
percent of the quota is payable in the member’s
own currency at a designated depository, nor-
mally the member’s central bank. The payment
is made either in domestic currency (IMF No. 1
and No. 2 Accounts) or by issuance of a prom-
issory note (IMF Securities Account). The No.
1 Account is used for the IMF’s operational
transactions (e.g., purchases and repurchases),
whereas the No. 2 Account is used for the pay-
ment of local administrative expenses incurred
by the IMF in the member’s currency. The
promissory notes are encashable by the IMF
on demand. The domestic portion of the quota
payment is not recorded in the member’s bal-
ance of payments or in the IIP (see paragraph
6.85), except for the No. 2 account (see below).
No interest is payable on either the deposit
account or the note.
7.76 There are periodic reviews of the size of mem-
ber quotas. Recording transactions that reflect a change
in a member’s quota is the same as the recording that
takes place when the quota is initially paid.
Reserve position in the IMF
7.77 Reserve position in the IMF of a coun-
try equals the sum of the reserve tranche plus any
indebtedness of the IMF (under a loan agreement) in
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

the General Resources Account that is readily avail-
able to the member country (for further details, see
paragraph 6.85). The reserve tranche represents the
member’s unconditional drawing right on the IMF,
created by the foreign exchange portion of the quota
subscription, plus increases (decreases) through the
IMF’s sale (repurchase) of the members’ currency to
meet the demand for use of IMF resources by other
members in need of balance of payments financing. A
member’s reserve position in the IMF constitutes part
of its reserve assets in the IIP.

7.78 To use its reserve tranche in the IMF, a mem-
ber may purchase foreign exchange from the IMF
with its own currency, provided that it has a balance
of payments need. The domestic currency, equal to
the value of the foreign exchange, is paid into the
IMF’s No. 1 Account with the member’s central bank
or through the issuance to the IMF of a promissory
note recorded in the IMF’s Securities Account. The
transaction is recorded in the balance of payments as a
reduction in the member’s reserve tranche in the IMF,
which is offset by an increase in the member’s other
reserve assets.

Credit and loans from the IMF

7.79 A member may make use of IMF credit or
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) loans
to acquire additional foreign exchange from the IMF.
Economically, the use of IMF credit and PRGF loans
results in the same outcome—that is, the member
entering into these agreements has access to foreign
exchange in return for agreeing to meet a set of con-
ditions. Both IMF credit and loans are classified as
loans under other investment, although the two types of
arrangements are executed in different ways:

A PRGF loan results in the member borrowing for-
eign exchange with a commitment to repay. Such
loans do not affect the IMF No. 1 Account.
When a member country uses IMF credit, it “pur-
chases” foreign exchange from the IMF in return
for its domestic currency. Use of IMF credit is
shown as the member’s liability (in SDRs) in the
balance of payments and IIP, whereas the sale
of domestic currency to the IMF in the No. 1
Account is not shown as a balance of payments
transaction or in the IIP. Liabilities under IMF
credit arrangements are extinguished when the
member uses foreign exchange to “repurchase” its
domestic currency.
7. 8 0 For use of IMF credit, if the value of the mem-
ber’s domestic currency changes in relation to the SDR,
“maintenance of value payments” are made once a year
in the No. 1 Account in domestic currency to maintain a
constant SDR liability. Because the liability is denomi-
nated in SDRs, the maintenance of value payments are
not entered as transactions in the balance of payments.
7. 81 A member may a lso extend credit or ma ke loa ns
to the IMF that are not considered to be a part of the
Reserve position in the IMF. Such a situation arises, for
example, in the circumstance where a member’s claim
on the IMF is not immediately encashable at a time of
balance of payments need.
Remuneration
7. 82 The IMF pays its members “remuneration”
quarterly on the basis of their reserve tranche posi-
tion, except for a small portion related to prior quota
payments in gold that are interest-free resources
to the IMF. This remuneration is classified on an
accrual basis as investment income–reserve assets–
interest (credit), which is offset by an increase in
reserve assets (debit).

IMF No. 2 Account
7. 83 As discussed above, the IMF No. 2 Account is
used by the IMF for administrative payments. Unlike the
No. 1 Account, it is reflected in the balance of payments of
a member as a liability. Transactions involving the No. 2
Account are recorded as increases or decreases in this lia-
bility and are offset by the source of funds (in the case of
an increase) or the use of funds (in the case of a decrease).
For example, when the IMF transfers funds from the No.
1 Account to the No. 2 Account in a member economy,
the member’s balance of payments shows an increase in
its reserve tranche (debit). The increase reflects the reduc-
tion in IMF holdings of the member’s currency in the No.
1 Account and is offset by an increase in the member’s
other investment liabilities relating to currency and depos-
its (credit). When the IMF uses funds from the No. 2
Account to pay for the acquisition of goods and services,
the balance of payments of the member shows a reduction
in this account (debit) and an offset (credit) under govern-
ment goods and services n.i.e.

Special drawing rights
7. 8 4 The SDR is an international reserve asset cre-
ated by the IMF in 1969. It is administered by the SDR
Department of the IMF, which is required by the IMF’s

Chapter 7 g International Investment Position
Articles of Agreement to keep its accounts strictly sepa-
rate from the General Resources Account. The SDR is
not a claim on the IMF. Rather, the membership of the
SDR Department incurs the asset or liability position.
Further information is covered in other chapters:

SDRs are instruments as defined in paragraphs
5.34–5.35.
SDR allocations received by a country are
reported as liabilities under other investment
(paragraph 6.61) and reserve-related liabilities
(paragraph 6.116).
SDR holdings are classified as reserve assets (para-
graph 6.84).

Chapter 8. Financial Account
A. Concepts and Coverage
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 11, The Financial Account.

8.1 The financial account records transactions that
involve financial assets and liabilities and that take
place between residents and nonresidents. The finan-
cial account indicates the functional categories, sectors,
instruments, and maturities used for net international
financing transactions. The financial account is clas-
sified according to the instrument and functional cat-
egories, as discussed in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively.
Table 8.1 shows some main headings in the financial
account. The left-hand column of Table 8.1 shows the
net acquisition of financial assets and the right-hand
column shows the net incurrence of liabilities. In the
presentation in Table 8.1, assets are shown before lia-
bilities, in accord with the order used in the IIP and
general practice. (However, if the double-entry record-
ing for the balance of payments as a whole needs to be
emphasized, the liabilities could be shown in the first
column. That presentation would be consistent with
corresponding entries being on opposite sides of the
accounts—e.g., a current account credit usually has an
increase in financial assets or reduction in liabilities as
its corresponding entry.)

8.2 Entries in the financial account can be corre-
sponding entries to goods, services, income, capital
account, or other financial account entries. For exam-
ple, the corresponding entry for an export of goods is
usually an increase in financial assets, such as currency
and deposits or trade credit. Alternatively, a transaction
may involve two financial account entries. Sometimes,
the financial account transaction involves the exchange
of one asset for another, for example, a bond may be
exchanged for currency and deposits. In other cases, the
transaction may involve the creation of a new financial
asset and corresponding liability.

8.3 The overall balance on the financial account is
called net lending/net borrowing. Net lending means
that, in net terms, the economy supplies funds to the rest
of the world, taking into account acquisition and disposal
of financial assets and incurrence and repayment of lia-
bilities. (Net borrowing means the opposite.) Despite the
lending-oriented terms, net lending/net borrowing is a
balance that takes into account equity, financial deriva-
tives, and monetary gold, as well as debt instruments.
Also, net lending includes reduction of liabilities and
net borrowing includes reduction in assets. Net lending/
net borrowing can be derived from either the sum of the
balances on the current and capital accounts or from the
balance on the financial account. In concept, the values
should be equal. For a surplus of credits over debits in
the current and capital accounts, there is a balancing net
acquisition of financial assets or reduction of liabilities,
which is shown in the financial account. Net lending/net
borrowing of the international accounts is also equal to
the net lending/net borrowing for the sum of the resident
sectors of the national accounts.
8.4 It may be of interest to show balances for com-
ponents of the financial account. For example, ana-
lysts may be interested in net flows for each functional
category—such as net direct investment derived as net
acquisition of direct investment assets less net incur-
rence of direct investment liabilities.
8.5 The financial account and the other changes in
assets and liabilities account show the contribution to
changes between the opening and closing stocks of finan-
cial assets and liabilities. (This relationship is also shown
in Table 7.1.) These linkages of the financial account
with the IIP and other changes accounts are made more
transparent by the use of consistent classifications.
8.6 As shown in Table 8.1, the financial account
shows net acquisition of financial assets and net incur-
rence of liabilities. Net acquisition of financial assets
can be labeled net changes in financial assets, which is
wider in that it includes changes resulting from other
flows, as well as transactions. Similarly, net incurrence
of liabilities can be called net changes in liabilities.

Net recording

8.7 Net recording in the financial account means
aggregations whereby all debit entries of a particular
asset or a particular liability are netted against all credit
entries in the same asset type or in the same liability
type. However, changes in financial assets should not
be netted against changes in liabilities, with the pos-
sible exception for financial derivatives noted in para-
graph 8.34 and in the balancing item. To illustrate the
correct use of netting, acquisition of portfolio invest-
ment in equity is netted against the sales of that type of
equity; new bonds issued are netted against redemption
of bonds issued; but acquisition of bond assets is not
netted against incurrence of bond liabilities. The net
recording principle should be applied at the lowest level
of classification of financial instruments, taking into
account the functional category, institutional sector,
maturity, and currency classifications, where applica-
ble. In contrast to the net recording used in the financial
account, the current and capital accounts are recorded
on a gross basis, as explained in paragraph 3.113.

8.8 Net recording of flows in financial assets and
liabilities are recommended in the international accounts
for both analytical and pragmatic reasons. Financial
markets are typified by large turnover. The focus of the
financial account is on the net changes in each of exter-
nal financial claims and liabilities due to transactions.
Also, gross reporting of data may not be possible for cer-
tain classes of units and for some financial instruments.

Gross recording on a supplementary basis
8.9 Data on gross flows are useful for analyzing
market turnover and market behavior, and for measur-
ing service fees generated. Often, a small net value may
be the outcome of large gross flows. Where practical
to do so, data on drawings and repayments on loans or
acquisitions or disposals of other instruments could be
made available to users on a supplementary basis. The
data could be provided comprehensively or only for
particular components.
Timing and valuation
8.10 General principles for the time of record-
ing for financial account entries are discussed in
paragraphs 3.54–3.59. Transactions involving finan-
cial assets are recorded when economic ownership
changes. Some financial liabilities, such as trade
credit and advances, are the result of a transaction
in nonfinancial items. In these cases, the financial
claim is deemed to arise at the time the correspond-
ing nonfinancial flow occurs.
8.11 In some cases, the parties to a transaction
may perceive ownership to change on different dates
because they acquire the documents evidencing the
transaction at different times. This variation usually is
caused by the time taken for delivery of documents and
processing of transactions. The amounts involved in
such “float” may be substantial in the case of transfer-
able deposits and other accounts receivable or payable.
If no precise date can be fixed, the date on which the
creditor receives payment or some other financial claim
can be adopted as a convention.

8.12 Financial account transactions in general are
recorded at market values, as discussed in paragraphs
3.68–3.80. (Market values are defined in paragraph
3.70.)

8.13 The value of financial instruments should
be recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, ser-
vice charges, regulatory levies, and taxes, whether
charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s price,
or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. Commissions
and dealers’ margins, as discussed in paragraphs
10.120–10.123, are payable in return for the provision
of financial services, so they should be excluded from
the instrument price and included in services, where
applicable. Therefore, the buyer and seller record
financial account transactions, at the same mid-price,
that is, the midpoint between the buyer’s price and the
seller’s price.

B. Direct Investment
8.14 Direct investment is defined in paragraphs
6.8–6.24. Specific issues in direct investment are
discussed in the following paragraphs. Direct invest-
ment from direct investor to direct investment
enterprise, reverse investment, and between fellow
enterprises are identified separately. Presentation
of direct investment financial flows according to
the directional principle is discussed in paragraphs
6.42–6.45 and Box 6.4.

1. Reinvestment of earnings

8.15 Reinvestment of earnings arising from a direct
investor’s equity in its direct investment enterprise is
recorded as an imputed financial account entry. It is
the corresponding entry and equal to reinvested earn-
ings, which is an item in the primary income account
(defined in paragraphs 11.33–11.36; it is the direct
investor’s share of the retained earnings or net saving
of the direct investment enterprise, before reinvested
earnings payable are deemed distributed). The finan-
cial account entry is shown separately under direct
investment equity.

8.16 Reinvestment of earnings may be negative
in some cases, for example, in case of losses by the
direct investment enterprise or if dividends payable in
a period are larger than net earnings in that period. Just
as positive reinvested earnings are treated as being an
injection of equity into the direct investment enterprise
by the direct investor, negative reinvested earnings is
treated as a withdrawal of equity.

2. Direct investment flows in kind

8.17 Goods, services, and other resources may be
supplied by or to affiliated enterprises at above or
below market prices, or with no payment. For example,
a direct investor may supply machinery and equipment
to its direct investment enterprise. As discussed in
paragraphs 3.77–3.78, 10.35, and 11.101–11.102, when
such flows are able to be valued, in principle there is a
corresponding entry for direct investment. When goods
and services are supplied below cost by a direct inves-
tor to a direct investment enterprise, if there is no other
indication about the motivation, it can be assumed to
be for the purposes of building up the direct investor’s
equity in the direct investment enterprise.
3. Mergers and acquisitions

8.18 Mergers arise when two or more companies
agree to combine into a single operation. Acquisitions
involve the purchase of one company or group of com-
panies by another company or group of companies
(though not all the shares may be acquired by the pur-
chaser). Mergers and acquisitions data are not identi-
fied as standard components within direct investment.
Nonetheless, there may be interest in such data because
the nature of mergers and acquisitions may differ from
other direct investment—for example, they may not
provide any new financing for the firms involved but
rather represent a change in investors. See OECD
Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment ,
Annex 9, which discusses the definition and collection
of data on merger and acquisition transactions.
4. Corporate inversion and other restructuring

8.19 Corporate inversion describes the corporate
restructuring of a transnational enterprise group such
that the original parent company in one economy
becomes a subsidiary of the new parent in another
economy. In addition, ownership of a group of enter-
prises may be shifted to the new parent company. Such
arrangements may be called corporate relocations,
headquarters relocations, or corporate restructuring.
The process may take place over more than one period.
Although corporate inversion has a similar economic
effect to a change of residence of the parent company
(as discussed in paragraphs 4.167 and 9.21), it differs
in that inversion is achieved by transactions in assets
between different entities, rather than by a single entity
changing its residence. So, corporate inversion results
in financial transactions being recorded in the financial
account. However, some other types of restructuring
Chapter 8 g Financial Account
may involve other changes in volume, for example, the
appearance or disappearance of entities.

8.20 While the economy of the direct investor is
changed by corporate inversion, the operational struc-
ture and ultimate shareholders remain effectively
unchanged, but the new parent company has the benefit
of the taxation and regulatory environment of its econ-
omy of incorporation. Because inversions can involve
large values in the financial account but with little or no
movement in resources, there may be analytical interest
in separating them from other direct investment. If not
prevented by confidentiality, supplementary data could
be provided.

8.21 In these cases, the assets of the original parent
company are treated as having been returned to the
shareholders of the parent company through the with-
drawal of equity and then as being reinvested in the
new parent company at the same value. That is, there
is a rearrangement of balance sheets through transac-
tions in equity in the financial account of equal value
with no change in net lending or borrowing. (These
entries may include both portfolio and direct invest-
ment.) With some forms of restructuring, the direct
investment enterprises of the old parent may become
the direct investment enterprises of the new one.

8.22 As noted, assets may be shifted from one enter-
prise to a second enterprise because of restructuring
within an enterprise group. As with other stock swaps,
the owners are selling securities in the first enterprise
and buying securities in the second enterprise. (These
are financial account entries, not capital transfers or
other changes.)

5. Superdividends

8.23 Superdividends and liquidating dividends are
defined in paragraphs 11.28 and 11.30. They are treated
as a withdrawal of equity, rather than as income payable
to the owners. Accordingly, these amounts are excluded
from dividends and are shown as a reduction in equity
in the financial account, just as any other withdrawal
of equity. They also arise for equity other than direct
investment.

6. Borrowing for fiscal purposes

8.24 Special rules apply to an entity owned or con-
trolled by general government when that entity is resi-
dent in another territory and is used for fiscal purposes.
Such entities are resident in their economy of incorpo-
ration or registration, and not in the economy of their

owner (as discussed in paragraphs 4.134–4.135). For
example, a government may use a special purpose or
other entity to issue securities to fund its expenditure.
Fiscal purposes refers to the distinctive motivation of
the general government sector, as discussed in para-
graphs 4.91–4.92. Fiscal purposes can be distinguished
from commercial purposes, because fiscal purposes
are always oriented to serving the objectives for the
government’s home territory.
8.25 When an entity resident in one economy bor-
rows on behalf of the government of another economy,
and the borrowing is for fiscal purposes, the following
entries are made:
(a) At the time of borrowing: a transaction creating
a debt liability of the government to the bor-
rowing entity is imputed equal to the amount of
the borrowing. (The corresponding entry is an
increase in the government’s equity in the bor-
rowing entity.)
(b) At the time funds (or resources acquired with the
funds) are passed to the government (as appli-
cable): the flow of funds is shown as a transac-
tion, matched by a reduction of the government’s
equity in the borrowing entity by the same
amount.
(c) At the time expenses are incurred or resources
or funds are provided by the borrowing entity
to a third party (i.e., are not passed to the gov-
ernment), where applicable: a current or capital
transfer between the government and the entity is
imputed, with the matching entry of a reduction
in the value of the government’s equity. (For a
wholly owned government entity, this imputation
has the same value as the reinvestment of earn-
ings that would have been imputed if the general
treatment for direct investment enterprises was
applicable.)
These entries are made symmetrically for both the gov-
ernment and the borrowing entity. These entries do not
affect the transactions or positions between the borrow-
ing entity and its creditors or other third parties, which
are recorded as they occur with no imputations.
8.26 The reason for having a special approach for
government entities is that, unlike in the private sec-
tor, the nonresident entity undertakes functions at the
behest of general government for public policy, not
commercial purposes. Without this approach, a mis-
leading picture of government expenditure and debt
could arise.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

C. Portfolio Investment
8.27 Portfolio investment is defined in paragraphs
6.54–6.57.

1. Reinvestment of earnings in investment
funds

8.28 Unlike other portfolio investment, the undis-
tributed earnings of portfolio investment in investment
funds are imputed as being payable to the owners and
then as being reinvested in the fund. The financial
account entry for reinvestment of earnings is the corre-
sponding entry to the reinvested earnings of investment
funds in the primary income account item (which is
covered in paragraphs 11.37–11.39). The treatment and
calculation of earnings are the same as for reinvested
earnings of direct investment enterprises. Reinvestment
of earnings may be negative, for example, when a fund
has paid dividends out of realized holding gains, or
when earnings accrued over previous periods are paid
as dividends.

2. Convertible bonds

8.29 The classification of convertible bonds is dis-
cussed in paragraph 5.45. When the option to convert
the bond into shares is implemented, two entries are
shown: (a) redemption of the bond and (b) the issue or
acquisition of shares.

3. Debt defeasance

8.30 Debt defeasance allows a debtor (whose debts
are in the form generally of debt securities and loans) to
remove certain liabilities from the balance sheet by pair-
ing irrevocably assets of equal value to the liabilities.

8.31 Defeasance may be carried out (a) by placing
the paired assets and liabilities in a trust account within
the institutional unit concerned, or (b) by transferring
the assets and liabilities to another institutional unit. In
the former case, there are no transactions with respect
to defeasance, and the assets and liabilities should not
be excluded from the balance sheet of the unit. In the
latter case, the transactions by which the assets and
liabilities are moved to the second statistical unit are
recorded in the financial account of the economies
concerned, provided the units are resident of different
economies, and are reported in the balance sheet of the
unit that holds the assets and liabilities. Therefore, debt
defeasance sometimes leads to a change in the institu-
tional unit that records those liabilities.

4. Share and debt buybacks
8.32 If a corporation buys its own shares, the trans-
action is classified as being a reduction in the equity
liability, rather than an acquisition of an asset. Because
a corporation cannot have a claim on itself, the liability
is deemed to be extinguished, even if the shares are not
canceled. Similarly, purchase of a debt security by its
issuer is treated as redemption of the debt.
5. Bonus shares
8.33 Sometimes corporations restructure their shares
and may offer shareholders a number of new shares for
each share previously held. This can be called stock
splits or the issue of bonus shares. In contrast to when
new shares are issued in return for additional funds,
in these cases, no new resources are provided and no
transaction is recorded.

D. Financial Derivatives (Other than Reserves) and Employee Stock Options
1. Financial derivatives
8.34 Financial derivatives (other than reserves) and
ESOs are defined in paragraphs 6.58–6.60. Transac-
tions involving financial derivatives may arise at incep-
tion, on secondary markets, with ongoing servicing
(such as for margin payments), and at settlement. Finan-
cial account entries for derivatives preferably should
be shown separately for each of assets and liabilities,
wherever possible, but net settlements are acceptable
when gross reporting is impractical. Any explicit or
implicit service charges should be deducted from the
value of the financial derivative. However, distinguish-
ing implicit service charges is not usually possible, in
which case, the entire value of the financial derivative
is classified as being for the financial asset.
8.35 At inception:
(a) The creation of a forward-type contract does not
generally require the recording of a transaction
in a financial derivative because risk exposures
of equal value are usually being exchanged. That
is, there is usually zero exposure and zero value
for both sides. In some cases, however, there may
be a nonzero transaction value at issue. (In addi-
tion, there may be a service charge for the issue,
as mentioned in paragraph 10.121.)
(b) The purchaser of an option pays a premium to
the seller, which is the acquisition price of the

Chapter 8 g Financial Account
instrument. Sometimes a premium is paid after
the inception of the contract. In that case, the
value of the premium is recorded at the inception
of the contract in the same manner as if it had
been paid then, but is shown as being financed
by accounts receivable/payable between the
writer and the purchaser.
8.36 Subsequent changes in the prices of derivatives
are recorded as holding gains or losses, not as transactions
(included as revaluation, see paragraphs 9.30–9.31).

8.37 Sales of options in secondary markets —
whether exchanges or over the counter—are valued at
market prices and recorded in the financial account as
transactions in financial derivatives.

8.38 When a contract requires ongoing servicing
(such as an interest rate swap, where each party meets
the servicing obligations that were originally held by
the other) and a cash payment is received, there is a
decrease (increase) in a financial derivative asset (lia-
bility) if, at the time of the payment, the contract is in
an asset (liability) position. If compilers are unable to
implement this approach because of market practice, all
cash receipts should be recorded as reductions in finan-
cial assets, and all cash payments should be recorded as
decreases in liabilities.

8.39 Margins a re payments of cash or deposits of col-
lateral that cover actual or potential obligations incurred
through financial derivatives—especially futures or
exchange traded options. (As discussed in paragraph
5.94, repayable margins in cash are classified as deposits
or other accounts receivable/payable, and nonrepayable
margins are classified as financial derivatives.)

8.40 At settlement , either a cash payment is made
or an underlying item is delivered.

(a) When a financial derivative is settled in cash,
a transaction equal to the cash value of the set-
tlement is recorded for the derivative. In most
instances, when a cash settlement payment is
received, a reduction in a financial derivative
asset is recorded. When a cash settlement pay-
ment is made, a reduction of a financial deriva-
tive liability is recorded.
(b) When an underlying item is delivered, two trans-
actions are recorded:
The transaction involving the underlying item
is valued at the market price at the time. The
entry for the underlying item is recorded under
the relevant heading (goods, financial instru-
ment, etc.).
- The transaction involving the derivative is
valued as the difference, multiplied by the
quantity, between the market price for the
underlying item and the strike price specified
in the derivative contract.
(c) When more than one contract is settled—in cash,
at the same time, and with the same counter-
party—some of the contracts being settled are
in asset positions and some are in liability posi-
tions. In this situation, transactions involving
assets should be recorded separately from those
involving liabilities, wherever possible, but net
settlements are acceptable when gross reporting
is impractical.
2. Employee stock options
8.41 An ESO is created on a given date (the “grant”
date), providing that an employee may purchase a given
number of shares of the employer’s stock at a stated
price (the “strike” price) either at a stated time (the
“vesting” date) or within a period of time (the “exer-
cise” period) immediately following the vesting date.
Transactions in ESOs are recorded in the financial
account as the corresponding entry to the compensa-
tion of employees (as discussed in paragraph 11.20) or
direct investment (paragraph 11.21). When the option is
exercised, the transaction in the ESO is recorded in the
financial account at a value that reflects the difference
between the market price of the equity and the price
paid by the buyer for the equity (see also paragraph
8.40(a) and (b)). Cancellation of ESOs is discussed
in paragraph 9.12, while revaluations are discussed in
paragraph 9.30. ESOs do not generally raise separate
issues to those for financial derivatives, but one special
case occurs when an employee of a subsidiary is issued
options for stock in the parent company. Because the
parent is not the employer, the subsidiary is shown as
acquiring the option from the parent. (If the subsidiary
pays nothing or an unrealistic value to the parent, a
value may be imputed, possibly direct investment, as
discussed in paragraph 11.101 on transfer pricing.)
E. Other Investment
1. One-off guarantees and other debt
assumption
8.42 Debt assumption means that one party takes
on the liability of another party. Debt may be assumed
under a preexisting guarantee, or without a guarantee,
such as when a government wants to assist a project

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

or a direct investor assumes the liabilities of its direct
investment enterprises for reputational reasons. One-
off guarantees are defined in paragraph 5.68. One-off
guarantees are recognized only as financial assets and
liabilities from the time they are activated.

8.43 The assumption of the debt may not require
repayment at once. According to the accrual principle
for time of recording, the assumption of the debt should
be recorded at the time the guarantee is activated, rather
than when actual payments are made by the guarantor.
Repayments by the new debtor and interest accrued on
the assumed debt should be recorded as these flows
occur.

8.44 The recording in the international accounts of
debt assumption through the activation of a one-off
guarantee or for other reasons varies depending on the
circumstances, as discussed in paragraph 8.45.

8.45 In all cases, the debt-assuming party records
the creation of a new liability to the creditor (financial
account entry). In addition:

(a) If the debt-assuming party does not acquire a
claim on the (original) debtor because the original
debtor no longer exists (e.g., the original debtor
has been liquidated), a capital transfer from the
debt-assuming party to the creditor is recorded
as the corresponding entry to the creation of the
liability. The original debt of the debtor to the
creditor is written off in the accounts of both the
original debtor and the creditor (other changes in
financial assets and liabilities account).
(b) If the debt-assuming party does not acquire a claim
on the (original) debtor because the debt assumer
seeks to give a benefit to the debtor (as is some-
times the case when governments assume debts),
then unless the guarantor is in a direct investment
relationship with the original debtor (see (c)), a
capital transfer from the debt-assuming party to the
original debtor is recorded. The claim on the origi-
nal debtor by the creditor is extinguished (financial
account entries).
(c) In other cases, the debt-assuming party acquires
a claim on the original debtor as a result of the
assumption of the debt (financial account entry).
Such a claim may be on the original debtor as a
debt^1 or as an increase in the guarantor’s equity
(^1) If the value of the debt claim received by the debt assumer is less
than the value of the debt liability assumed, as in (b) a capital trans-
fer for the difference is recorded, unless the parties are in a direct
investment relationship (see also paragraph A2.52).
in the original debtor (e.g., assumption of debt
owed by a subsidiary will improve the balance
sheet of the subsidiary and, hence, the direct
investor’s equity in the subsidiary). In this case,
the claim on the original debtor by the creditor is
extinguished (financial account entry).
(The entries are shown in Box 8.1.)

2. Insurance technical reserves, pension fund
entitlements, and provisions for calls under
standardized guarantees

8.46 Insurance, pension fund, and standardized
guarantee transactions need to be broken down into
their service, income, transfer, and financial account
elements. An overview of the statistical treatment of
insurance, pension schemes, and standardized guar-
antees is given in Appendix 6c. Insurance technical
reserves sometimes may be classified as direct invest-
ment, as discussed in paragraph 6.27. The following
paragraphs show the composition of the financial
account entries.
8.47 For nonlife insurance, insurance technical
reserves consist of prepayments of insurance premi-
ums and outstanding claims. Prepayments of premiums
result from the fact that, in general, insurance premi-
ums are paid in advance. Technical reserves against
outstanding claims are reserves that insurance enter-
prises hold to cover the amounts they expect to pay
out for claims that have been reported and are not yet
resolved and to cover estimates of claims incurred but
not yet reported—including equalization reserves that
relate to events that have occurred.
8.48 Similarly, for life insurance, pension schemes,
annuity funds, and standardized guarantee schemes,
the changes in technical reserves due to transactions
are recorded in the financial account and consist of
the amounts of the estimated obligations to beneficia-
ries and holders that accrued during the period. Pen-
sion entitlements include those under both funded
and unfunded schemes, but do not include potential
benefits under social security schemes (see paragraph
5.67). The increase in pension entitlements shown in
the financial account matches the entry in the use of
income accounts for the adjustment for change in pen-
sion entitlements plus any change in pension entitle-
ments due to capital transfers.
8.49 Totals for insurance technical reserves, pen-
sion fund entitlements, and provisions for calls under
standardized guarantees and related investment income
Chapter 8 g Financial Account
usually can be identified only in the accounts of insur-
ers, funds, and guarantee providers, rather than in the
accounts of their customers. For liabilities, these totals
relate to resident providers and need to be allocated
among resident and nonresident policyholders. In the
absence of specific data on the allocation of these values
to policyholders, an indicator such as premiums pay-
able may be used. For assets, the reserves, entitlements,
and provisions are liabilities of nonresidents and are not
observable by residents, so counterpart data or indicators
such as ratios of premiums to technical reserves may be
necessary. Changes in technical reserves resulting from
holding gains or losses are not transactions and therefore
are recorded in the revaluation account and not in the
financial account.

3. Special drawing rights

8.50 The allocation of SDRs to IMF members is
shown as the incurrence of a liability of the recipient
under SDRs in other investment, with a corresponding
entry under SDRs in reserve assets.

8.51 Other acquisitions and sales of SDRs are shown
as transactions in reserve assets.
4. Securities repurchase agreements and
other reverse transactions
8.52 These arrangements are defined in paragraphs
7.58–7.61. Because the risks and rewards of ownership
stay largely with the original owner, no transaction in
the security is recorded. If one party provides cash that
is repayable when the security is returned, however, the
provision of cash is classified as a loan (except when
it is a liability of a deposit-taking corporation and part
of broad money, in which case it is classified as other
deposits).
5. Currency
8.53 Transactions in issued banknotes and coin are
recorded under currency and deposits. Transactions by
residents with nonresidents using domestically issued
banknotes and coin are recorded as transactions in lia-

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

If debt-assuming party does not acquire a claim on the (original) debtor because the
original debtor no longer exists (paragraph 8.45(a)):
Original debtor: other change in volume of debt liability to creditor
Assumer: increase in debt instrument liability (credit) to creditor
capital transfer (debit) to creditor
Creditor: capital transfer (credit) from assumer
increase in debt instrument claim (debit) on assumer
other change in volume of debt claim on original debtor
If debt-assuming party does not acquire a claim on the (original) debtor because the
debt assumer seeks to give a benefit to the debtor (paragraph 8.45(b)):
Original debtor: capital transfer (credit) from assumer
reduction in debt instrument liability (debit) to creditor
Assumer: increase in debt instrument liability (credit) to creditor
capital transfer (debit) to original debtor
Creditor: reduction in debt instrument claim (credit) on original debtor
increase in debt instrument claim (debit) on assumer
If debt-assuming party acquires a claim on the original debtor (paragraph 8.45(c)):
Original debtor: increase in equity or debt liability (credit) from assumer
reduction in debt instrument liability (debit) to creditor
Assumer: increase in debt instrument liability (credit) to creditor
increase in equity or debt claim (debit) on original debtor
Creditor: reduction in debt instrument claim (credit) to original debtor
increase in debt instrument claim (debit) on assumer
In cases in paragraphs 8.45(b) and (c), three parties are involved in the transaction, so the
treatment differs from the standard double-entry system.
Box 8.1. Entries Associated with Different Types of Debt Assumption
(Showing different situations, recording party, entry, and counterparty)
bilities, and transactions by residents with nonresidents
using foreign-issued banknotes and coin are transac-
tions in assets. As noted in paragraphs 3.7–3.8, transac-
tions in domestic liabilities between nonresidents and
transactions in foreign assets between residents are not
recorded in the balance of payments.

6. Change of contractual terms

8.54 If the original terms of a debt (typically a loan or
debt security, but also other debt items) are changed by
renegotiation by the parties, then the treatment is that the
original liability is repaid and a new liability is created.
In contrast, if the original terms of the contract provide
that the maturity or interest rate terms or both change as a
result of an event such as a default or decline in credit rat-
ing, then this involves a reclassification. (This distinction
has an effect on net values in practice in cases in which
the original and new terms have a different principal,
different instrument classification, or different maturity
classification; otherwise, the entries cancel out.)

F. Reserve Assets
8.55 Transactions involving monetary gold are
recorded in the financial account only if they occur
between two monetary authorities for reserve purposes
or between a monetary authority and an international
financial organization. (Monetary gold is discussed in
paragraphs 5.74–5.78; and gold in the context of reserve
assets is discussed in paragraphs 6.78–6.83.)

8.56 All transactions in gold bullion other than
those included in monetary gold are recorded as non-
monetary gold in the goods and services account (dis-
cussed in paragraphs 10.50–10.54). When a monetary
authority acquires gold bullion from, or sells gold
bullion to, an institutional unit other than a monetary
authority or international financial organization, the
gold is monetized or demonetized, as discussed in
paragraphs 9.18–9.20.
8.57 Financial account transactions with the IMF
involve reserve assets, reserve-related liabilities, other
investment, and off-balance-sheet liabilities. They are
dealt with in detail in Annex 7.1.
G. Arrears
8.58 The accumulation of arrears related to excep-
tional financing (when it occurs) needs to be included
as a memorandum item to the financial account. Excep-
tional financing is defined and discussed in Appen-
dix 1. Incurring arrears does not involve a transaction,
because it is a unilateral act of one party. Therefore, it
is not shown as giving rise to entries in the standard
presentation of the financial account. However, if the
debt is renegotiated, then the original instrument is
extinguished and a new instrument is created.
8.59 In addition to arrears related to exceptional
financing, other arrears indicate potential, or actual,
problems servicing debt, and so may be shown as sup-
plementary items.
Chapter 8 g Financial Account
Chapter 9. Other Changes in Financial Assets and Liabilities Account
A. Concepts and Coverage
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 12, The Other Changes in Assets
Accounts.

9.1 In the international accounts, the other changes
in financial assets and liabilities account shows
changes in financial positions that arise for reasons
other than transactions between residents and non-
residents. These changes are also called “other flows.”
Examples include the unilateral cancellation of debt by
the creditor, holding gains and losses, and reclassifica-
tions (including arising from resident-to-resident trans-
actions in financial assets issued by nonresidents). In
international accounts, other changes are recorded only
for financial assets and liabilities because the inter-
national investment position relates only to external
financial assets and liabilities.

9.2 While sometimes derived as residual items,
other changes are economic events that are important
in their own right and should be shown separately
from transactions. They serve to demonstrate signifi-
cant changes to the value and composition of items in
the balance sheet due to events that have important
economic consequences.

9.3 Other changes differ from transactions in terms
of their economic nature and accounting entries. A
transaction is an interaction between two institutional
units by mutual agreement or operation of the law,
whereas other changes are changes in the value or
volume of assets and liabilities that arise from other
economic events. Each transaction involves two
accounting entries for each party, as does reclassifica-
tion, but other events recorded in this account involve
a single entry for each party. For additional aspects
of accounting for other changes, see also paragraphs
3.19–3.21 (types of other flows), 3.60 (timing), and
3.81–3.83 (valuation).

9.4 Table 9.1 shows an overview of the other changes
in financial assets and liabilities account. The balanc-
ing item for the account is net changes in net IIP arising
from other changes.
9.5 Together with the financial account, the other
changes in financial assets and liabilities explain
changes in the IIP. In other words, financial assets and
liabilities gain or lose value and appear or disappear
as a result of transactions, other volume changes, or
revaluation. This relationship can be expressed as the
following identity:
Beginning of period position
+ Transactions during the period
+ Other changes in volume during the period
+ Revaluation during the period:
Of which, due to:
exchange rate changes and
other price changes
= End of period position.
(Table 7.1 also shows this relationship.)
9.6 The other changes in financial assets and
liabilities account can be presented by the type of
asset or liability as well as by the type of other flow.
The classification by type of asset or liability should
be consistent with that used in the IIP and financial
account to facilitate analysis of particular assets and
a comprehensive view of asset and liability positions.
The other changes in assets and liabilities account
can also be considered in conjunction with investment
income from the income account, to obtain another
view of the return on financial assets and liabilities.
As noted in paragraph 9.32, some retained earnings
affect the owners’ equity through the other changes
account, whereas others affect equity through an
imputed transaction.
B. Other Changes in the Volume of Financial Assets and Liabilities
9.7 Other changes in the volume of financial assets
and liabilities are any changes in the value of these
assets that are due neither to transactions nor to revalu-
ation. These changes include those due to cancellation
and write-offs, economic appearance and disappear-
ance of assets, reclassification, and the changes in
financial assets arising from entities changing their
economy of residence .Becauseoftheheterogeneous

9.10 Unilateral cancellation of a financial claim by
a debtor (debt repudiation) is not recognized. Debt for-
giveness, which is a capital transfer, usually concerns
government debt; most commercial situations where
the impossibility of debt collection is recognized by the
creditor are treated as write-offs.

9.11 Governments or other institutional units may
take possession of the assets of other institutional units,
including nonresident units, without full compensation
for reasons other than the payment of taxes, fines, or
similar levies. If the compensation falls substantially
short of the values of the assets as shown in the bal-
ance sheet, the difference should be recorded in other
changes in volume as an increase in assets for the insti-
tutional unit doing the seizing and a decrease in assets
for the institutional unit losing the asset. Such actions
are called uncompensated seizures of assets in the 2008
SNA. For seizures between residents and nonresidents
relating to nonfinancial assets, a supplementary item
can be recorded.

9.12 If an employee stock option is extinguished
between the grant and vesting dates (e.g., if the employee
departs) without an agreed settlement between the par-
ties, an other change in volume is recorded (namely,
a loss of an asset by the employee and a reduction of
liabilities by the employer).

2. Reclassifications

9.13 A reclassification entry is necessary when a
financial asset or liability changes its characteristics or
status without there having been a cross-border transac-
tion. In contrast to reclassifications, other cases—such
as changes such as conversion of a convertible bond
(see paragraph 8.29) and exercise of a warrant (see
paragraph 5.87) —are shown as transactions involving
repayment of the original instrument and creation of a
new one because they arise from bilateral agreements.

Tradable loans

9.14 A loan may become a security in the circum-
stances discussed in paragraph 5.45. In that case, the
deduction of nominal value of the old loan is a reclas-
sification, as is the appearance of the new security at
market prices.

Change in contractual terms

9.15 The original terms of a contract may provide
that the maturity and interest rate terms change as a
result of an event such as a default or decline in credit

rating; then this involves a reclassification. In contrast,
a change in the terms as a result of renegotiation by the
parties is a transaction, and thus is shown as a repay-
ment of the old instrument and issue of a new one in the
financial account.
Transactions in existing assets
9.16 Transactions in existing assets can result in
changes in the composition of assets and liabilities in
the IIP. As noted in paragraph 3.7, when a financial
instrument issued by a nonresident is sold by a resident
in one institutional sector to a resident in another sec-
tor, the composition of assets in the IIP is changed by a
reclassification entry.
Changes in functional category
9.17 As a result of a change in the relationship
between the parties or change in the liquidity of assets,
the functional category may be changed. For example,
if the relationship between the parties changes to direct
investment because an investor adds to its holdings
and so qualifies as a direct investor, the previous hold-
ings would be reclassified to direct investment. (See
also paragraph 6.36.) Another example is a loan that
is reclassified as securities (see paragraph 5.45) and so
from other investment to portfolio investment.
Monetization and demonetization of gold bullion
9.18 A special case of change in classification
occurs for gold bullion. Gold bullion can be a financial
asset (monetary gold) or a good (nonmonetary gold),
depending on the holder and the motivation for holding.
Monetization is the change in the classification of gold
bullion from nonmonetary to monetary. Demonetiza-
tion is change in the classification of gold bullion from
monetary to nonmonetary. The treatment of particular
transactions is as follows:
(a) When a monetary authority sells gold bullion
that is a reserve asset to a nonresident entity
that is not a monetary authority or international
financial organization, an entry for nonmone-
tary gold is recorded in the goods and services
account. Demonetization of the gold bullion
occurs immediately before the transaction and is
shown in the other changes in assets and liabili-
ties account of the monetary authority.
(b) When a monetary authority sells gold bullion
that is a reserve asset to a resident entity that
is not a monetary authority, there is no interna-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

tional transaction. As in case (a) above, demon-
etization of the gold bullion occurs immediately
before the transaction.
(c) When a monetary authority purchases gold bul-
lion from a nonresident that is not a monetary
authority or international financial organization,
the transaction is recorded in nonmonetary gold
in the goods and services account. Monetization
of the gold bullion occurs immediately after the
transaction and is shown in the other changes
in assets and liabilities account of the monetary
authority.

(d) When a monetary authority purchases gold bul-
lion from a resident for its reserve assets, there
is no international transaction. As in case (c)
above, monetization of the gold bullion occurs
immediately after the transaction.

(e) When buyer and seller are monetary authorities
of different economies and both hold the gold
bullion as part of their reserve assets, there is
a transaction in gold bullion (recorded in the
financial account; see paragraph 8.55). The
same treatment applies for transactions in gold
bullion between a monetary authority and an
international financial organization.

(f) If the monetary authorities deposit gold bullion
that they own in an unallocated gold account, the
gold bullion is demonetized immediately before
the transaction. If the account is with a non-
resident, a transaction in nonmonetary gold is
recorded in the goods and services account with
a corresponding entry in currency and deposits,
and then a reclassification to monetary gold—
unallocated gold accounts—if held as a reserve
asset. However, if the deposit is with another
monetary authority or an international financial
institution, transactions in monetary gold are
recorded (see paragraph 6.80).

(g) Similarly, if the monetary authorities withdraw
gold bullion from an unallocated gold account
held as a reserve asset, a reclassification to cur-
rency and deposits is recorded before the trans-
action. As the account is with a nonresident, a
transaction in currency and deposits is recorded
with a corresponding entry in nonmonetary gold
in the goods and services account. The gold bul-
lion is monetized as monetary gold—gold bul-
lion, if held as a reserve asset. However, if the
deposit is with another monetary authority or an
international financial institution, transactions

in monetary gold are recorded (see paragraph
6.80).
(h) In other cases, gold bullion is nonmonetary at
all times and any international transactions are
recorded in nonmonetary gold under goods (as
discussed in paragraphs 10.50–10.54).
(The above cases relating to a monetary authority also
apply to an international financial organization.)
Reclassification of unallocated gold accounts
9.19 Unallocated gold accounts are classified as cur-
rency and deposits unless they are held by the mon-
etary authorities as part of reserve assets. Unlike gold
bullion, unallocated gold accounts have counterpart
liabilities. To be classified as monetary gold, the unal-
located gold accounts must be held as part of reserve
assets, and so the counterpart liability is necessarily on
a nonresident.
9.20 If a monetary authority acquires an unallocated
gold account to be classified as reserve assets, it is
recorded first as a transaction in currency and deposits
and then reclassified to monetary gold (unallocated
gold accounts) as a change of classification in the other
changes in the volume of assets and liabilities account
of the monetary authority. Removing an unallocated
gold account from reserve assets is recorded as, first,
a change in classification from monetary gold to a cur-
rency and deposit in the other changes in the volume
account and then a transaction in currency and depos-
its. However, transactions between monetary authori-
ties and with international financial institutions are
recorded as transactions in unallocated gold accounts
within monetary gold if the unallocated account is held
as a reserve asset.
3. Financial assets and liabilities of persons and
other entities changing residence
9.21 The conditions under which entities can change
their economy of residence were discussed in Chap-
ter 4. When persons and other entities change their
economy of residence, their existing financial assets
and liabilities are added to or removed from the IIP
through a reclassification, not by imputing transactions
in the balance of payments. The change in the residence
does not involve a transaction between two entities,
but a change in the status of a single entity. Because
of the treatment of ownership of land and buildings,
as well as certain other cases (discussed in paragraphs
4.34–4.40), notional units may be created or eliminated

Chapter 9 g Other Changes in Financial Assets and Liabilities Account
as a result of the change in residence status of an owner.
The treatment of change in residence applies to all the
financial assets and liabilities, not just those that are
shifted to the new economy of residence.

9.22 In addition to change in the status of exist-
ing assets, new financial claims and liabilities may
be created by transactions around the time of change
of residence. For example, new bank accounts may
be created in the new economy of residence. In those
cases, the treatment is determined by the residence
status of the owner at the time of the transaction. If the
relation of the timing of the transaction and the change
of residence is unknown or effectively simultaneous, a
convention can be adopted, such as that the change of
residence occurs first.

9.23 Corporations sometimes change residence. Most
cases labeled as corporate migration involve moving
assets between entities (see paragraph 8.19 on corporate
inversion). However, in the exceptional case when cor-
porate change of residence occurs (see paragraph 4.167),
the change in the residence of the owner of financial
assets and liabilities is treated as a reclassification, in the
same way as a change of residence of individuals.

4. Insurance reserves, pension entitlements,
and provisions for standardized guarantee
schemes

9.24 Changes in model assumptions can give rise
to other changes in the volume of insurance reserves,
pension entitlements, and provisions for standardized
guarantee schemes. For an annuity, the relationship
between premiums and benefits is usually determined
when the contract is entered into, taking account of
mortality data available at that time. Any subsequent
changes will affect the liability of the annuity provider
towards the beneficiary, with the consequent changes
in provisions recorded as other changes in volumes.
In contrast to changes in model assumptions, changes
in pension entitlements negotiated between the parties
are transactions, so would be classified as current or
capital transfers.

C. Revaluation
9.25 Revaluations occur because of a change in the
monetary value of a financial asset or liability due to
changes in the level and structure of its price. Revalu-
ations may also be called holding gains or losses. As
the term suggests, holding gains or losses are changes
in the value of an asset that accrue purely as a result of

holding assets over time without transforming them in
any way. A holding gain occurs when an asset increases
in value or a liability decreases in value; a holding loss
occurs when an asset decreases in value or a liability
increases in value. Common causes of revaluation are,
for equity, changes in expectations of future incomes
and, for debt securities, changes in market yields and
the creditworthiness of the debtor.
9.26 Because of the importance of instruments
denominated in foreign currencies in the IIP and their
different behavior, the values of revaluation are sepa-
rated into those due to two factors:
(a) exchange rate changes and
(b) other price changes.
9.27 Exchange rate changes show all the changes
that result from exposure to the effect of exchange rates,
whereas the other price changes show other causes such
as asset price volatility. Revaluation takes into account
all price changes during the period, whether realized
or not. Holding gains and losses are realized when the
asset is sold or liability extinguished. Holding gains
and losses on unsold assets and unpaid liabilities are
unrealized, but are recorded as revaluation in the other
changes in financial assets and liabilities account.
9.28 An exact measure of the factors could be made
by tracking each instrument held, bought, or sold dur-
ing the period. In practice, an approximation can be
derived from balance sheet aggregates for each cur-
rency of denomination, to separate revaluation into
exchange rate changes and other price changes, accord-
ing to the following steps:
Step 1: The effect of revaluation due to other price
changes is derived for each class of instrument
and currency of denomination by subtracting
changes due to transactions and other changes in
volume from the total change in positions. Because
exchange rate changes are always zero in the
currency of denomination, all revaluation when
expressed in the currency of denomination is due
to other price changes. (The currency of denomi-
nation is discussed in paragraphs 3.95–3.107.)
Step 2: The beginning and end of period posi-
tions, and changes due to transactions, other vol-
ume changes, and revaluation due to other price
changes (as derived in Step 1) are converted to
the currency of international accounts compilation
using the appropriate exchange rates. Positions are
converted by the exchange rate at the relevant date.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Ideally, transactions and other flows would be con-
verted at the exchange rate at the time of each
event or flow. In the example in Box 9.1, flows are
converted at the average exchange rate, which is
an approximation that assumes that flows, price
changes, and exchange rate movements occurred
evenly through the period. If an average exchange
rate is used, an average of daily exchange rates is
preferable as an approximation. (An average of
beginning and end of period rates could be mis-
leading when rates did not move evenly through
the period.) Currency conversion is discussed in
paragraphs 3.104–3.108.
Step 3: The effect of revaluation due to exchange rate
changes is derived for each class of instrument and
currency of denomination by subtracting changes
due to transactions, other changes in volume, and
revaluation due to other price changes from the total
change in positions. The exchange rate effects are
always zero on instruments denominated in the cur-
rency of international accounts compilation (with
the exception set out in paragraph 9.31).
Step 1 needs to be calculated for each currency of
denomination by type of instrument, although in prac-
tice currencies that represent a small proportion of the
total may be combined. For instruments that are valued
at nominal prices, there can be exchange rate effects,
but no other price changes. A numerical example is
given in Box 9.1.

1. Debt reorganization

9.29 A debtor and creditor may change the terms of
a debt agreement. The terms may be changed such that
the value of the new claim differs from the value of the
old claim. In commercial situations, differences in val-
ues between old and new claims are generally treated
as a valuation change. Debt cancellation and write-offs
are other volume changes and were discussed in para-
graphs 9.8–9.11. However, as noted in paragraph 13.23,
if there is an intention to convey a benefit, the change
may be treated as a capital transfer. Debt reorganization
is discussed in further detail in Appendix 2.

2. Financial derivatives and employee stock
options

9.30 The exchanges of claims and obligations at the
inception of a derivative contract are financial transac-
tions creating asset and liability positions that normally
have, at inception, zero value if the instrument is a

forward-type contract and value equal to the total pre-
mium payable if the instrument is an option. Changes
in the value of derivatives due to change in the underly-
ing item are recorded as revaluation. (Changes in the
value of derivatives to or from zero are classified as
revaluation, not economic appearance or disappearance
of assets.) The settlement of a financial derivative posi-
tion is a transaction, recorded in the financial account.
Changes in the values of employee stock options at or
after the vesting date are revaluations (see paragraphs
3.59, 7.39, and 11.20). (In practice, it may be feasible to
recognize the revaluation only at exercise date.)
9.31 Financial derivatives that include a foreign
exchange risk are a case where the steps for separating
exchange rate and other revaluation, as stated in para-
graph 9.28, are not applicable. In those cases, a valua-
tion change due to exchange rate changes can arise even
in the currency of denomination of the instrument. In
some cases, such as cross-currency swaps that are also
interest rate swaps, it may not be practical to separate
exchange rate changes from other revaluation, so a con-
vention that all revaluation effects are due to exchange
rate effects may be adopted.
3. Implications of different treatments of
retained earnings
9.32 In cases where retained earnings are not
imputed as being payable to the owners, these earnings
contribute to revaluation. The SNA and international
accounts have two treatments for retained earnings:
- For direct investors’ equity in their direct investment
enterprises and for investment fund shares, retained
earnings are imputed as being payable to the owners
and reinvested as an increase in their equity. (The
primary income account entries are discussed in
paragraphs 11.33–11.47; the corresponding financial
account entries in paragraphs 8.15–8.16 and 8.28.)
Similarly, insurance and pension fund reserves and
provisions for calls under standardized guarantees
include property income attributed to policyholders.
(The primary income account entries are discussed
in paragraphs 11.77–11.84.)
- In other cases of equity, there is no imputation
of income or financial account transactions to
the owners on account of retained earnings. The
result is that the increase in the value of the equity
caused by the accumulation of retained earnings
is reflected in increased value in the IIP without a
transaction and is, therefore, shown as a result of
revaluation.

Chapter 9 g Other Changes in Financial Assets and Liabilities Account
4. Implications of trading of instruments that
are recorded at nominal values in positions

9.33 Nominal valuation is used for positions in
nonnegotiable instruments, namely loans, deposits,
and other accounts receivable/payable (see para-
graphs 7.40–7.44). However, when transactions in
these instruments do occur, they are valued at market
prices (see paragraph 8.12), with transaction prices
often being less than the nominal values, because
the market price takes account of the possibility of
default. To account for the inconsistency between
the market valuation of transactions and nominal
valuation of positions, the seller records other price
changes during the period in which the sale occurs,
equal to the difference between the nominal and the

transaction value and the buyer records an opposite
amount as other price changes.
5. Implications of treatment of interest
9.34 Any indexation amounts not included in inter-
est are classified as revaluation. The treatment of inter-
est on index-linked instruments is discussed in more
detail in paragraphs 11.59–11.65.
9.35 Revaluation arises from changes in market yields
on fixed-interest debt securities. The value of interest
is determined by the yield to maturity at inception (see
paragraphs 11.52–11.53), so the effect of any subsequent
change in the value of the security due to changes in mar-
ket interest rates is classified as being due to revaluation.

The steps are described in paragraph 9.28. The data in
normal text are given; the data in bold are derived.
Step 1. Derivation of other revaluation in terms of the cur-
rency of denomination of the instrument (in this case, ):
Other revaluation can be derived as 8, i.e., 50 (end of
period position) – 30 (beginning of period position) – 12
(net transactions) – 0 (other volume changes) = 8.
Step 2. Conversion of currency of denomination to the
currency used for compilation of international accounts
statistics (in this case from  to domestic currency):
Beginning of period positions are multiplied by 2; flows
by 2.5 (rate derived as the average rate on the period); and
end of period positions by 3.
Step 3. Derivation of exchange rate changes in the
currency used for compilation of international accounts
statistics: For the bonds denominated in , revaluation
due to exchange rate changes can be derived as 150 (end
of period position) – 60 (beginning of period position)
30 (net change due to transactions) – 20 (net change
due to other revaluation) = 40.

tistics: Concepts and Definitions.

International Trade in Services.
10.1 The goods and services account shows trans-
actions in items that are outcomes of production
activities.

10.2 The focus of this account is the point at which
goods and services are exchanged between a resident
and a nonresident. In contrast, the national accounts
focus on other points, such as their production, con-
sumption, or use in capital formation.

10.3 Production is an activity in which an enter-
prise uses inputs (intermediate inputs, labor, pro-
duced and nonproduced assets) in order to transform
them to an output that can be supplied to other units.^1
(In a few cases, the output is supplied to the unit
itself.) The term “product” is used in the SNA to cover
both goods and services.

10.4 The corresponding entries to goods and ser-
vices flows may be in the financial, current, or capital
accounts. For items paid for at the same time as the pro-
vision of the good or service, the corresponding entry is
in the financial account, such as in currency and depos-
its. When payment is not made at the time of change
of ownership, trade credit or another form of financial
instrument (such as a bill of exchange) is established. If
payment is made before change of ownership, there is

an advance from the importer to the exporter. In some
cases, goods and services are exchanged for something
other than financial assets; for example, in the case
of barter, there is a corresponding entry in goods and
services. In the case of aid or gifts, the corresponding
entries are under current or capital transfers.
10.5 Table 10.1 shows the broad structure of the
goods and services account. There are balancing items
for goods, services, and the total of goods and services.
Distinction between goods and services
10.6 The distinction between goods and services
and other entries is determined by the nature of eco-
nomic value supplied. Goods and services represent
outcomes of the production process. In contrast, when
other resources, such as labor, land, or other natural
resources, or financial resources, are supplied, they
are shown in other accounts. The goods and services
account can include transactions in products that were
generated in previous periods (e.g., second-hand goods,
software, research embodied in patents, and invento-
ries) and goods and services that embody a large pro-
portion of output of other economic territories (e.g.,
re-exports and goods under merchanting).
10.7 Goods are physical, produced items over which
ownership rights can be established and whose economic
ownership can be passed from one institutional unit to
another by engaging in transactions. They may be used to
satisfy the needs or wants of households or the community
or used to produce other goods or services. The produc-
tion of a good can be separated from its subsequent sale or
resale. Goods are shown separately from services.
10.8 Services are the result of a production activity
that changes the conditions of the consuming units, or
facilitates the exchange of products or financial assets.
Services are not generally separate items over which
ownership rights can be established and cannot gener-
ally be separated from their production. However, as seen

later in this chapter, some knowledge-capturing products,
such as computer software and other intellectual property
products, may be traded separately from their production,
like goods. In the balance of payments goods and ser-
vices account, the valuation of goods includes transport
within the exporting economy as well as wholesale and
retail services indistinguishably in the price of the goods.
Furthermore, the value of some service items includes the
values of some goods, in the cases of travel, construction,
and government goods and services n.i.e. Some services,
particularly manufacturing services, repairs, and freight
transport, also relate to goods.

10.9 In practice, the distinction made between goods
and services sometimes takes into account other con-
siderations, such as data sources.

10.10 E-commerce is a method of ordering or deliv-
ering products at least partly by electronic means, such
as through the Internet or other computer-mediated
networks. In general, charges for electronically deliv-
ered products are usually included in services, whereas
products supplied across the border are usually classi-
fied as goods (see Table 10.4 for further details). Ship-
ping charges associated with e-commerce are allocated

in line with the FOB valuation principle. Financial
services associated with e-commerce are included in
financial services.
Transactions between affiliated enterprises
10.11 A high proportion of exchanges of goods and
services are between affiliated enterprises. This situation
gives rise to issues of treatment and valuation. For exam-
ple, where a direct investor temporarily provides equip-
ment to its direct investment enterprise, there may be an
operating lease. Additional guidance on goods deliveries
between affiliated enterprises is provided in paragraph
10.24. Management and ancillary services may also be
provided, as discussed in paragraph 10.150. These cases
may give rise to issues of valuation, as discussed in para-
graphs 3.77–3.78 and 10.35. Consequential effects on
income are discussed in paragraphs 11.101–11.102.
Price and volume data
10.12 Goods and services have price and volume
dimensions, so it is useful for analysis and data valida-
tion to have volume and price data, as well as current
price values.

1. General merchandise

a. Introduction

10.13 General merchandise on a balance of pay-
ments basis covers goods whose economic ownership
is changed between a resident and a nonresident and
that are not included in the following specific catego-
ries: goods under merchanting (see paragraphs 10.41–
10.49), nonmonetary gold (paragraphs 10.50–10.54),
and parts of travel (paragraph 10.94), construction
(10.101), and government goods and services n.i.e.
(paragraph 10.173).

10.14 International merchandise trade statistics
(IMTS) are usually the main data source for general mer-
chandise in the goods and services account. The interna-
tional standards for merchandise trade data are set out in
United Nations IMTS: Concepts and Definitions. These
standards are closely linked to those in this Manual. In
practice, the data used as sources for general merchandise
include customs data, international transactions reporting
systems, other administrative data (including value-added
tax systems), surveys of traders, or combinations. Adjust-
ments to source data may be needed to account for cover-
age, timing, valuation, and classification that do not meet
balance of payments guidelines.

10.15 General merchandise is shown as a single
item in the standard components. This Manual does
not propose standards for breakdowns of goods, but
encourages presentations according to the priorities
of the compiling economy. More detailed breakdowns
could include major products (or commodities), major
product groups, industry of origin, and broad economic
categories. The international standard product (or com-
modity) classifications include the Harmonized System
(HS) , the Standard International Trade Classifica-
tion , and the Central Product Classification (CPC).^2
In addition, or alternatively, cross-references could be
made to additional details available in other publica-

tion and Coding System. United Nations, Standard International Trade
Classification. United Nations, Central Product Classification.
tions, while noting coverage, timing, valuation, and
classification differences.
10.16 IMTS cover goods “which add to or subtract
from the stock of material resources of a country by enter-
ing (imports) or leaving (exports) its economic territory”
(United Nations IMTS: Concepts and Definitions 1998,
paragraph 14). This basis differs from the change of own-
ership between residents and nonresidents required for
balance of payments, so adjustments may be needed.
b. Items to be included in general merchandise
10.17 Because there is a change of ownership of
goods between a resident and a nonresident, the fol-
lowing cases are included in the balance of payments
definition of general merchandise:
(a) Banknotes and coins not in current circulation
and unissued securities. They are valued as com-
modities, rather than at face value. Banknotes
and coins may be not in circulation because they
have not yet been issued, or they have been with-
drawn from circulation and demonetized. Sales
of coins to or between collectors at a premium
are valued at the transaction price, rather than
the face value. (Banknotes and coins in circula-
tion and issued securities are financial instru-
ments and are excluded from goods.);
(b) Electricity, gas, and water. However, charges
invoiced separately for the transmission, trans-
port, or distribution of these products are
included in services under transport and other
business services—see paragraphs 10.74 and
10.159. Allowing water to flow when that flow
is required by international law on river flows is
not an international transaction;
(c) Noncustomized packaged software (systems and
applications), and video and audio recordings, on
physical media, such as disks and other devices,
with a license for perpetual use are included in
general merchandise. These products are included
at their full transaction value (i.e., not at the
value of the empty disks or other storage device).
Software provided in this manner is included in
goods; other software is included in services—see
paragraphs 10.143–10.144.^3 (Noncustomized soft-
ware is for general use, rather than being made to

identify separately software included in goods so as to compare or
combine it with software included in services.

order. For classification of customized software
and other cases, see Table 10.4.);
(d) Goods procured in ports by carriers. Goods
such as fuels (bunkering), provisions, stores,
ballast, and dunnage procured by nonresident
transport operators in ports from resident pro-
viders are included in exports of general mer-
chandise. Similarly, goods procured by resident
transport operators from nonresident provid-
ers are included in imports. Ports are defined
widely to include sea and ocean terminals,
airports, inland waterways, and providers of
goods and services used in a territory by road
and rail transport service providers that are
residents of another economy. Goods procured
by ship’s crew, drivers, etc. for their own use
are included in travel. Maintenance and repair
costs of transport operators are transport ser-
vices covered in paragraph 10.72. Fuel costs
of small-scale transport operators are goods
procured in port by carriers rather than travel
(see paragraph 10.81);
(e) Goods supplied or acquired by carriers away
from the territory of residence of the operator.
For example, fish and other marine products
caught by ships operated by residents of the com-
piling economy and sold abroad directly should
be included. Similarly, oil and minerals retrieved
from the ocean floor by resident operators and
sold abroad directly should be included. The
goods could be acquired or sold in foreign ports
or at sea to foreign vessels;
(f) Goods acquired by a lessee under a financial
lease. Financial leases are defined in paragraph
5.56. Because the lessee is the economic owner,
a change of ownership between the seller of the
goods and the lessee is recorded at the start of
the lease. The lessor has legal title but does not
have economic ownership. In contrast, goods
under operating leases do not change ownership
to the lessee, and thus are not included in gen-
eral merchandise when delivered to the lessee.
(Operating leases are discussed in paragraphs
10.153–10.156.);
(g) Goods sent abroad without a change of own-
ership, but later sold. Goods sent abroad on
consignment or for storage, repair, exhibition,
processing, and so forth without a change of
ownership are not recorded at the time they are
sent abroad, but if they are later sold to a resident
of an economy different from that of the owner,
they should be recorded in general merchandise.
(See paragraph 10.29 for further information on
goods on consignment.);
(h) Equipment that is sold while outside the territory
of residence of its original owner. For example,
equipment originally taken out of the territory
for temporary purposes, such as construction,
exhibition, or fishing, may be subsequently sold
or given away;
(i) Illegal goods;
(j) Smuggled goods that are otherwise legal;
(k) Gifts;
(l) Parcel post where there is a change of owner-
ship;
(m) Goods lost or destroyed after ownership has
been acquired by an importer but before the
goods have crossed a frontier. (However, goods
lost or destroyed before ownership has been
acquired by an importer are excluded from mer-
chandise trade);
(n) Livestock that changes ownership;
(o) Government sales of goods to and purchases
of goods from nonresidents. Acquisitions of
military equipment from nonresidents should be
included in general merchandise. Goods supplied
by governments to their own embassies, military
bases, and so forth involve resident-to-resident
transactions and so are not covered in the inter-
national accounts. Expenditure by embassies,
military bases, and so forth is included under
government goods and services n.i.e. (see para-
graph 10.175);
(p) Goods where there is no associated payment,
such as those financed by grants or loans;
(q) Humanitarian aid in the form of goods;
(r) Goods transferred to or from a buffer stock orga-
nization;
(s) Goods acquired to be processed without passing
through the territory of the owner (see paragraph
10.65) and goods sold after processing without
passing through the territory of the owner (see
paragraph 10.66); and
(t) Any other goods where there is a change of own-
ership that was not identified from data sources.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

10.18 When a customs system is used as a source of
data on goods, there is a need to make adjustments to
include any goods where there is a change of owner-
ship not recorded in customs data or travel. Cases that
sometimes arise include shuttle trade (see paragraph
10.19); acquisition of ships, aircraft, and satellites;
trade between free trade zones of an economy and
residents of other economies; goods in bonded ware-
houses in economies that use the special trade system;
and amounts below customs thresholds.

10.19 Goods for resale acquired by travelers
while on visits (sometimes called shuttle trade) are
included in general merchandise. Shuttle trade cov-
ers transactions involving the purchase of goods in
an economy by travelers (nonresidents) who then
transport these goods back to their economy of
residence where they are to be sold; goods pur-
chased by travelers in their home country for resale
abroad; and goods purchased by travelers abroad
in one economy and sold abroad in a second econ-
omy. It is sometimes also called informal cross-
border trade. Because the intent of this travel is not
to acquire goods for personal use—recorded under
travel—but to engage in a business and to make a
profit, the goods acquired and sold are recorded
under general merchandise. (Other expenses
incurred by these traders are dealt with in para-
graphs 10.17(d), 10.72, and 10.81.)

10.20 Goods for own use or to give away acquired
by travelers in excess of customs thresholds and
included in customs statistics are also included in
general merchandise. For example, durable goods
(such as cars and electrical goods) and valuables
(such as jewelry) may be acquired in this way and
be brought back to the territory of residence of the
owner. This treatment is consistent with international
merchandise trade statistics, but care is needed to
avoid double counting such goods by including them
also under travel. (See paragraphs 10.86–10.90 for
goods included in travel.)

10.21 When an international transactions report-
ing system is used as a source of data on goods,
there is a need to make adjustments to include any
goods where there is a change of ownership but no
associated payment. Examples include humanitar-
ian goods as aid, goods as gifts, goods provided to
affiliated enterprises, goods under barter transac-
tions, goods under trade credit, and goods where
payment involves residents’ bank accounts held in
other economies.

c. Items to be excluded from general merchandise
because there is no international transaction
10.22 Because there is no change of ownership of
goods between a resident and a nonresident, or because
the goods have no value, the following cases are
excluded from general merchandise:
(a) Transit trade. These goods are admitted under spe-
cial customs procedures that allow the goods to
pass through the territory. They are excluded from
the general merchandise of the territory of transit;
(b) Migrants’ personal effects. The personal prop-
erty that accompanies people changing residence
is not classified as a transaction because there is
no change in ownership;
(c) Goods consigned to embassies, military bases,
and so forth from their home authorities and
vice versa;
(d) Goods sent to an enterprise’s external operations
where those operations are not sufficiently sub-
stantial to constitute a branch. A common exam-
ple is goods sent abroad from the home base for
use in a construction project not undertaken by
a separate entity; these goods are not included in
exports of general merchandise of the territory
of the home base;
(e) Goods temporarily exported or imported without
a change of ownership. Examples include goods
for repair, as part of an operating lease, and for
storage, and animals or artifacts for participation
in exhibitions or competitions. (Such movements
of goods should be tracked, so as to identify
cases where the goods are subsequently sold,
rather than returned; see paragraph 10.17(g).
Identification of these movements may help
identify associated items, such as repair, operat-
ing leases, storage services, exhibition charges,
and competition winnings.);
(f) Goods for assembly, packing, labeling, or pro-
cessing by an entity that does not own the goods
concerned. (Both inward and outward move-
ments of such goods should be tracked, to assist
in identifying associated charges for assembly,
etc., to be recorded in manufacturing services on
physical inputs owned by others, as discussed in
paragraphs 10.62–10.71. These values also help
identify cases where the goods are subsequently
sold, rather than returned, in which case they are
identified as an export from the owner’s economy
at the time of sale.);
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
(g) Goods acquired by a lessor under a financial
lease. Financial leases are defined in paragraph
5.56. Although the lessor has legal title, it does
not have economic ownership. (The goods are
shown as being acquired by the lessee; see para-
graph 10.17(f).);
(h) Goods with no positive value (e.g., dangerous
goods exported for disposal or storage). These
goods are not general merchandise, but could
give rise to associated disposal or storage ser-
vices; see paragraph 10.152. However, waste and
scrap with positive values are included in gen-
eral merchandise;
(i) Returned goods. In these cases, the goods were
not accepted, or a change of ownership occurred
but the parties later agreed to annul the change of
ownership. It is recommended that revised entries
should be made to exports and imports for the
period when the goods were initially recorded,
so as to remove the voided transaction especially
for returns of occasional, high-value goods. How-
ever, for statistical convenience, deductions from
exports and imports may be made in the periods
when the goods are returned for minor cases;
(j) Samples of no commercial value;
(k) Trade in goods between free trade zones and
residents of the same economy; and
(l) Any other goods that have been included in the
data source although there was no change of
ownership.
d. Items to be excluded from general
merchandise because they are included elsewhere

10.23 The following items are excluded from gen-
eral merchandise because they are included in other
components of goods and services:

(a) Goods acquired or sold by residents but that do
not enter the economic territory are shown sepa-
rately as goods under merchanting, as discussed
in paragraphs 10.41–10.49;
(b) Nonmonetary gold, as bullion and other forms,
is shown as a separate item within goods, as
discussed in paragraphs 10.50–10.54;
(c) Goods that are included in travel, as discussed in
paragraphs 10.89–10.91;
(d) Goods locally acquired for construction under-
taken by enterprises that are nonresident in the
territory of the location of the work. These goods
are included under construction, as discussed in
paragraph 10.104;
(e) Devices, such as disks, with stored computer
software or data, that have been customized to
order are included under computer services, as
discussed in paragraph 10.143;
(f) Products such as packaged software (systems
and applications), video and audio recordings,
and so forth that are delivered on disks, mag-
netic media, or storage devices, but are obtained
with a fixed-period license to use (so that they
require ongoing periodic payments) rather than
with change of economic ownership. (These
products are included in computer or audiovi-
sual and related services; see paragraphs 10.143
and 10.163, respectively. For related products
included in goods, see paragraph 10.17(c).);
(g) Licenses to reproduce or distribute (or both)
audio and video that are conveyed by supply
of the original recording are included under
charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e.,
as discussed in paragraph 10.137; and
(h) Customized blueprints and nonbulk newspapers
and periodicals sent on the basis of direct sub-
scription are included in information services.
(However, the bulk provision of newspapers and
periodicals is included in general merchandise.)
e. Deliveries between affiliated enterprises
10.24 Many cross-border movements in goods
are between affiliated enterprises. The goods may
be moved for processing, resale, and other purposes.
The question may arise as to whether there has been
a change of economic ownership. (For example, para-
graph 10.22(f) covers the treatment of goods deliv-
ered for processing without a change of ownership.)
Whether there has been a change in economic owner-
ship is determined according to the usual principle
that the economic owner is the party that bears the
risks and rewards of ownership. In cases where there
has been a change of possession of goods between
affiliated enterprises, but it is not known whether
there has been a change in ownership, the following
factors should be considered:
When affiliated enterprises are separate legal enti-
ties, their transactions should be treated according
to the parties’ own arrangements as to whether
there is a change of ownership or not.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Between a quasi-corporation and its owner, legal
title is not usually available as evidence of the
nature of the movement of goods. The preferred
treatment in this case is to identify which part of
the legal entity assumes the risks and rewards of
ownership, based on evidence such as which loca-
tion has the goods recorded in its accounts and is
responsible for the sale of the goods. The treatment
should be consistent with reporting by the branch
in business accounts and enterprise or establish-
ment surveys.
f. General and special trade

10.25 International merchandise trade statistics may
be prepared on either a general or special trade basis:

The general trade basis covers goods registered
to enter the economic territory, including bonded
warehouses and free trade zones. The general trade
system is preferred in the United Nations IMTS:
Concepts and Definitions. It is also preferable for
international accounts statistics because it captures
transactions involving goods for the whole econ-
omy and is more consistent with the coverage of
the corresponding financing entries.
The special trade basis in the strict sense covers
goods cleared to enter the free circulation area
only. If only special trade system data are avail-
able, adjustments are needed for goods movements
into and out of bonded warehouses, export pro-
cessing zones, and commercial free zones.
g. Time of recording

10.26 Transactions involving general merchandise
should be recorded at the time of the change of own-
ership of the goods. Maximizing consistency in the
time of recording between the exporter and importer,
the change of ownership matches the time when the
corresponding financial account entries are made
(such as currency and deposits or trade credit). Goods
are considered to change ownership when the parties
enter the goods in their books as a real asset and make
a corresponding change to their financial assets and
liabilities.

10.27 IMTS: Concepts and Definitions recommends
that the time of recording be based on when the goods
enter or leave the territory, with the date of lodgment
of the customs declaration a suitable approximation. In
practice, some data sources may be based on the time
of processing the declarations, which is unsatisfactory

if there are either long or variable lags in the time taken
to process records. There will be lags between the time
of export of a good and the time of its corresponding
import arising from the period in which the goods are
at sea or in transit through other countries. Ideally for
international accounts statistics purposes, source data
would be adjusted by:
(a) removing recorded merchandise movements that
did not involve a change of ownership in the
period, and
(b) adding merchandise that changed ownership
during the period but was recorded in the source
data in earlier or later periods.
In practice, the timing of the change of ownership is
usually assumed to be approximately the same as the
time of customs recording.
High-value capital goods
10.28 The production of high-value capital goods
such as ships, heavy machinery, and other equipment
may take several months or years to complete. As with
other goods, the transaction should be recorded at the
time that economic ownership is conveyed from the
seller to the buyer. The time of ownership change is
as arranged between the parties; for example, it could
be a progressive change in line with stage payments,
or in full on delivery. The timing in data sources may
or may not coincide with the change of ownership; for
example, payments data are on the basis of stage pay-
ments, whereas customs data are on the basis of the
time that the completed item crosses the customs fron-
tier. (If change of ownership differs from time of pay-
ment, accounts receivable/payable arise, as discussed
in paragraph 5.71.)
Goods on consignment
10.29 Goods on consignment are intended for sale,
but their sale has not been arranged at the time they
are dispatched. Similarly, for goods sent for auction or
for temporary storage before sale, the change of owner-
ship may not occur until later. Such goods should not be
included in the international accounts until ownership
changes, to avoid a source of discrepancies between
the goods flow and the corresponding financial entries.
However, if it is impractical to record the transactions
in this way, they can be approximated by the time of
recording in international merchandise trade statistics.
If there is a substantial delay in the sale of the goods, it
is good practice in major cases to make adjustments to
the actual time of change of ownership.
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
h. Valuation

10.30 The principle for valuation of general mer-
chandise is the market value of goods at the point of
uniform valuation. The point of uniform valuation is
at the customs frontier of the economy from which the
goods are first exported, that is, free on board (FOB).
Market value is discussed in paragraphs 3.67–3.80.

10.31 The terms of delivery of goods are the responsi-
bility of the buyer and seller of goods under each contract.
The arrangements made between exporters and import-
ers vary. As a result, transaction prices agreed between
exporters and importers include varying amounts of dis-
tribution costs, including none, some, or all of wholesal-
ing, transport, insurance, and taxes. An example is given
in Box 10.2. Data from international transactions report-
ing systems and business surveys use transaction prices,
and so have a variable mix of valuation bases.

10.32 IMTS use FOB-type valuation as the statisti-
cal value of exports and CIF-type for imports. FOB-
type valuations include:

(a) FOB—at port on the frontier of the exporting
country (for goods dispatched by sea or inland
waterway);
(b) “free carrier” (FCA) —at terminal on the frontier
of the exporting country (for goods dispatched
by means of transport to which FOB is not appli-
cable); and
(c) “delivered at frontier” of the exporting country
(for goods dispatched by means of transport to
which FOB and FCA are not applicable; e.g.,
when goods are exported by railroad or pipe-
line).
(Where the customs frontier is not applicable, such as
where there is a single market, the territorial frontier is
used in its place. There may be cases where the appli-
cation of FOB-type values is problematic, such as for
goods under merchanting, nonmonetary gold changing
ownership without delivery, or goods processed and
sold in the economy of processing, so a transaction
value is used.)

10.33 CIF-type valuations include:
(a) “cost, insurance, and freight” (CIF) at the border
of the importing country; and
(b) “carriage and insurance paid” to the border of
the importing country.
10.34 To convert imports from CIF to FOB valu-
ation for international accounts purposes, the value

of freight and insurance premiums incurred from the
frontier of the exporting country to the border of the
importing country should be deducted. Ideally, CIF
to FOB adjustment for imports should be obtained
for each goods transaction, or at a detailed level. The
relationship of FOB to CIF prices varies according to
factors such as the type of good, weight, scale (bulk
or not), special needs (such as refrigeration or careful
handling), mode of transport, and the distance trav-
eled. CIF to FOB ratios change over time, due to fac-
tors such as fuel prices, competition and technology
in the transport industry, change in the proportion
of different types of goods, and changes in source
economies. For goods when the customs points of the
exporting and importing territory are contiguous, the
CIF and FOB values would be the same.^4 The FOB
valuation point means that export taxes are treated
as payable by the exporter and that import duties and
other taxes of the importing economy are payable by
the importer. To the extent that this is not the case,
adjustments like those for freight and insurance are
necessary.
10.35 In some cases an estimate of a market-
price equivalent price may need to be made. (See
paragraphs 3.71–3.79 for more details.) For exam-
ple, barter trade, aid goods, provision of goods and
services between affiliated enterprises, under- or
overinvoicing, goods on consignment or for auction,
or where goods change ownership but a final price
is determined later may require adjustment to the
goods value. Such adjustments may also require cor-
responding financial account items, such as trade
credit; in the case of goods supplied by direct inves-
tors to their direct investment enterprise below cost
or without charge, the corresponding entry is direct
investment equity.
10.36 Compilers should verify that realistic valu-
ations have been used in customs declarations, rather
than notional figures, such as zero, or a price that is
small or highly rounded. In the cases when the price
is determined later, subsequent adjustments should
be made to take into account the final price when it
becomes available. The recording of possible adjust-
ments is discussed further in paragraph 3.73.
(^4) However, for some merchandise trade between neighboring ter-
ritories, insurance and freight costs may be incurred between the cus-
toms frontiers, such as for air shipments, or in other cases when either
customs frontier is away from the border, such as where goods are
cleared for customs in sealed containers from the point of dispatch.

i. Re-exports

10.37 Re-exports are foreign goods (goods produced
in other economies and previously imported) that are
exported with no substantial transformation from the
state in which they were previously imported.^5 The price
of the re-exported good may differ from its price at the
time it was originally imported, due to factors such as
transport costs, dealer’s margins, and holding gains or
losses. For goods to be included in re-exports for balance
of payments statistics, a resident must acquire then resell
the goods with the goods passing through the territory.
Goods that are bought and resold but do not pass through
the territory of the owner are included in goods under
merchanting—see paragraph 10.41. Goods in transit are
not recorded in imports or in re-exports—see also para-
graph 10.22(a). As well, goods cleared by customs, but
re-exported without coming into ownership by a resident
of that economy, should not be included in re-exports
for balance of payments statistics purposes. In contrast
to re-exports, in the case of returned goods, there is no
change of ownership or the parties later agree to annul
the change of ownership (see paragraph 10.22(i)).

10.38 In cases where the state of the imported goods
is substantially transformed, which could be indicated by
a change in HS code, goods are recorded as domestically
produced exports rather than re-exports (e.g., goods that
have been assembled or processed, or goods that have
become rags, waste, scrap, antiques). Used goods that
were previously imported and retain the same HS code,
but have suffered wear and tear, could in most cases be
included in re-exports depending on the rules of origin
that the economy applies. Whereas international recom-
mendations^6 on rules of origin exist, the origin of the
goods will be determined at a national level. The case
of imported goods processed without change of own-
ership is discussed in paragraphs 10.62–10.70. Goods
temporarily imported or re-exported without a change of
ownership, such as for repair or operating lease, are not
included, as discussed in paragraph 10.22(e).

10.39 Where possible, re-exports should be shown
separately as a supplementary item, particularly in econ-
omies where re-exports are a significant proportion of
exports. Because re-exported goods are not produced
in the economy concerned, they have less connection to
the economy than do other exports. Economies that are

(^5) For treatment of re-exports in IMTS, see United Nations, IMTS:
Concepts and Definitions , 1998, paragraphs 78 and 79.
(^6) World Customs Organization, International Convention on the
Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (Revised
Kyoto Convention).
major transshipment points and locations of wholesalers
often have large values of re-exports. It may be of inter-
est to derive the value of imports destined for re-export,
calculated from re-exports with any timing adjustment.
10.40 Re-imports are domestic goods imported in
the same state as previously exported, without any sub-
stantial transformation occurring on the goods while
they were outside the territory. Where significant, re-
imports may be shown separately. Re-imports tend to
arise in order to reverse a previous export, while re-
exports generally arise because of transport, storage,
or distribution through a territory other than that of
the buyer or seller. For the goods to be included in re-
imports, a nonresident must have acquired the goods,
then resell them to a resident. (In cases where there was
no change of ownership, they are omitted from imports;
e.g., goods for repair or goods sent for processing.)

2. Other goods
a. Goods under merchanting
10.41 Merchanting is defined as the purchase of
goods by a resident (of the compiling economy) from a
nonresident combined with the subsequent resale of the
same goods to another nonresident without the goods
being present in the compiling economy. Merchanting
occurs for transactions involving goods where physical
possession of the goods by the owner is unnecessary
for the process to occur. (If guidance is needed about
the meaning of same goods, the criteria in paragraphs
10.37–10.38 can be used.)
10.42 Merchanting arrangements are used for whole-
saling and retailing. They may also be used in com mod-
ity dealing and for the management and financing of
global manufacturing processes. For example, an enter-
prise may contract the assembly of a good among one
or more contractors, such that the goods are acquired by
this enterprise and resold without passing through the
territory of the owner.^7 If the physical form of the goods
is changed during the period the goods are owned, as
a result of manufacturing services performed by other
entities, then the goods transactions are recorded under
general merchandise rather than merchanting. In other
cases where the form of the goods does not change, the
goods are included under merchanting, with the sell-
ing price reflecting minor processing costs as well as

(^7) If there is no change of ownership of the goods, there is no mer-
chanting transaction, but there may be manufacturing services on
physical inputs owned by others for a fee, as discussed in paragraphs
10.62–10.64.
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account

wholesale margins. In cases where the merchant is the
organizer of a global manufacturing process, the selling
price may also cover elements such as providing plan-
ning, management, patents and other know-how, mar-
keting, and financing. Particularly for high-technology
goods, these nonphysical contributions may be large in
relation to the value of materials and assembly.

10.43 Goods under merchanting are recorded in the
accounts of the owner in the same way as any other
goods it owns. However, the goods are shown separately
in international accounts statistics of the economy of

the merchant because they are of interest in their own
right and because they are not covered by the customs
system of that economy.
10.44 The treatment of merchanting is as follows:
(a) The acquisition of goods by merchants is shown
under goods as a negative export of the economy
of the merchant;
(b) The sale of goods is shown under goods sold
under merchanting as a positive export of the
economy of the merchant;
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Example 1—Merchanting with manufacturing services that do not change the
condition of the goods
A resident of Economy A acquires books from a resident of Economy B for 10. The resident
of Economy A has them sent to Economy C, without the books passing through Economy
A, for a resident of Economy C to put in boxes, for a charge of 3 payable by the resident of
Economy A. The books are then sold by the resident of Economy A to a resident of Economy
D for 20.
Since the goods are in the same condition, the merchanting treatment applies.
The goods and services account entries for Economy A would be:
Goods under merchanting (with Economy B) –10 CR. (negative exports)
Goods under merchanting (with Economy D) 20 CR.
Net exports of goods under merchanting 10 CR.
Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned 3 DR.
by others (with Economy C)
(The counterpart entries in Economies B and D would appear as exports and imports,
respectively, under general merchandise, because goods under merchanting is only used for
the economy of the merchant.)
Example 2—Manufacturing services that change the condition of the goods
A resident of Economy A acquires oil from a resident of Economy B for 10. The oil is sent
to Economy C, without passing through Economy A, for refining by a resident of Economy C,
for a charge of 15; the oil continues to be owned by the resident of Economy A. The oil is then
sold to a resident of Economy D for 30.
Since the goods are not in the same condition, the processing services treatment applies.
The goods and services account entries for Economy A would be:
General merchandise (with Economy B) 10 DR.
General merchandise (with Economy D) 30 CR.
Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned 15 DR.
by others (with Economy C)
(See also paragraphs 10.62–10.71 on manufacturing services and related issues associated
with processing.)
Economy B records goods exports to Economy A (10 CR.), Economy C records only manu-
facturing services exports A (not exports or imports of goods), and as noted above, Economy
D records goods imports from Economy A (not goods imports from Economy C).
In both examples, Economy C may wish to identify the values of goods received and goods
sent abroad as supplementary items.
Box 10.1. Examples of Goods under Merchanting and Manufacturing
Services on Physical Inputs Owned by Others (Processing Services)
(c) The difference between sales over purchases of
goods for merchanting is shown as the item “net
exports of goods under merchanting.” This item
includes merchants’ margins, holding gains and
losses, and changes in inventories of goods under
merchanting. As a result of losses or increases
in inventories, net exports of goods under mer-
chanting may be negative in some cases; and
(d) Merchanting entries are valued at transaction
prices as agreed by the parties, not FOB.
(Box 10.1 contrasts the entries for goods under mer-
chanting with those for goods under processing.)

10.45 Merchanting items appear only as exports in
the accounts of the economy of the territory of the
merchant. In the counterpart exporting and import-
ing economies, export sales to merchants and import
purchases from merchants are included under general
merchandise.

10.46 Wholesaling, retailing, commodity dealing,
and management of manufacturing may also be carried
out under arrangements where the goods are present
in the economy of the owner, in which case they are
recorded as general merchandise, rather than as mer-
chanting. In cases where the goods do not pass through
the economy of the owner, but the physical form of the
goods changes, because they are processed in another
economy, international transactions are recorded under
general merchandise, rather than merchanting. (The pro-
cessing fee is recorded as a manufacturing service paid
for by the owner, as discussed in paragraph 10.62.)

10.47 Sometimes a purchaser may be uncertain
whether the goods will be resold to residents of the
same economy or others. In this case, intentions can
be used as an indicator, with subsequent adjustment if
intentions are not realized.

10.48 When a merchant resells goods to a resident
of the same economy as the merchant, this does not
meet the definition of merchanting. Accordingly, the
purchase of goods is shown as imports of general mer-
chandise to the economy in that case. If the entity that
purchased from a merchant in the same economy sub-
sequently resells the goods to a resident of another
economy, whether or not the goods enter the economy
of the merchant, the sales of goods are recorded in
exports of general merchandise from the economy of
the merchant. (Although such a case is very similar
to merchanting, it does not meet the definition given
above. In addition, it is impractical for the first mer-
chant to record the purchases as merchanting because

that merchant may not know whether or not the second
merchant will bring the goods into the economy.)
10.49 Merchanting of nonmonetary gold is included
under the nonmonetary gold item, discussed in para-
graphs 10.50–10.54. This treatment means that the non-
monetary gold item is comprehensive and conceptually
symmetric.
b. Nonmonetary gold
10.50 Nonmonetary gold covers all gold other than
monetary gold. Monetary gold, as defined in paragraphs
5.74–5.75, is owned by monetary authorities and held as
a reserve asset. Nonmonetary gold can be in the form of
bullion (i.e., gold bullion takes the form of coins, ingots,
or bars with a purity of at least 995 parts per 1,000,
including such gold held in allocated gold accounts), gold
powder, and gold in other unwrought or semimanufac-
tured forms. Jewelry, watches, and so forth that contain
gold are included under general merchandise, not non-
monetary gold. Nonmonetary gold sales and purchases
that are not shipped are valued at transaction prices, not
FOB. The price should include any dealer’s margins or
commissions not billed separately.
10.51 Allocated gold accounts are treated as being
arrangements for the storage of gold bullion. A change
in ownership of an allocated gold account holdings
is, therefore, treated in the same way as gold bullion
(see paragraph 9.18). For the same reason, allocated
gold accounts are not treated as deposits. If an entity
puts gold it already owns into an allocated account,
or withdraws gold from an allocated account without
selling it, no change of ownership occurs so no transac-
tion is recorded. In contrast, unallocated gold accounts
are financial assets (included under monetary gold or
deposits, depending on the holder). As a result, a deposit
of bullion to an unallocated gold account is shown as
an exchange of nonmonetary gold for a financial asset;
and a withdrawal is the reverse unless both parties
are monetary authorities or international organizations.
(See also paragraphs 5.76–5.77 on gold accounts and
9.18 on transactions in gold bullion.)
10.52 When both parties to a gold transaction are
either monetary authorities that hold the gold as reserve
assets or international financial organizations, gold
sales are recorded as monetary gold in the financial
account, as discussed in paragraph 8.55. Otherwise,
gold sales are recorded under nonmonetary gold.
10.53 Nonmonetary gold is shown separately from
other goods because of the special role of gold in
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
financial markets, because gold sales and purchases
largely relate to existing stocks, and because the val-
ues of sales and purchases may be particularly large
in some cases, such as gold dealing centers. In many
cases, there is no physical delivery to the new owner,
because the gold is held at specialized bullion storage
centers. However, change in ownership is the criterion
for the recording of nonmonetary gold, so gold sales
and purchases should be recorded even when there is
no physical movement.

10.54 Nonmonetary gold may be held either as a
store of value or for other (industrial) purposes, such
as manufacturing of jewelry or for use in dental work.
When feasible, nonmonetary gold can be subdivided
into gold held as a store of value and other (industrial)
gold as supplementary data.

3. Reconciliation between merchandise trade
data and total goods on a balance of payments
basis

10.55 It is a good practice for compilers to produce
and publish a reconciliation table of the differences
between merchandise trade statistics and goods on a
balance of payments basis. A sample reconciliation
table is shown in Table 10.2. Such a table ensures trans-
parency and avoids confusion and doubts as a result of
different sources, coverage, classification, valuation,
timing, and so forth.

10.56 The table summarizes the steps taken in
compilation. Some of the items are discussed in more
detail in this chapter above. Annex E of IMTS: Com-
pilers Manual lists differences between IMTS and
BPM5 standards. In addition to changes from BPM5
in this Manual , other adjustments may arise if there
are differences between IMTS and the national prac-
tices for coverage of international merchandise trade
statistics.

1. Concepts and coverage
10.57 Following the general principles in paragraph
3.47, the time of recording of service entries in the
international accounts is the time at which the service is
delivered. The provision of services should be recorded
on an accrual basis in each accounting period, that is,
they should be recorded as they are rendered. Payment
may be made up front, at the end, or as progress pay-
ments. To the extent that the time of payment differs
from the time of delivery, there may be trade advances
(financial assets/liabilities that are extinguished as the
service is provided) or trade credit (financial assets/
liabilities that arise as the service is provided).
10.58 Services provided by a consultant, indepen-
dent contractor, or employment agency are distin-
guished from compensation of employees. Paragraphs
11.11–11.13 discuss the difference between an employee
and a service provider.
10.59 Services that are “outsourced”—that is, where
a company contracts another (specialist) company to
provide services that were previously internal com-
pany functions, such as billing services or information
“help” services—should be classified to the appropriate
services item. Services supplied by “call centers” and
similar types of operations should be classified accord-
ing to the type of service provided. For example, call
centers selling products are included in trade-related
services, whereas call centers providing computer sup-
port are included in computing services.
10.60 The Manual on Statistics of International
Trade in Services (MSITS) is a source of additional
information for compilers of international trade in ser-
vices data. MSITS uses the same conceptual framework
as the 2008 SNA and this Manual.^8 MSITS responds to
information needs related to the General Agreement on
Trade in Services (GATS) and other trade agreements,
as well as growing information needs of governments,
business, and analysts. It describes and clarifies the
four modes through which services can be supplied
internationally. Building on the services classifica-
tion included in this Manual , MSITS provides a fur-
ther breakdown of the classification of transactions by
type of services through the Extended Balance of Pay-
ments Services (EBOPS) Classification. It also further
extends the meaning of trade in services to cover ser-
vices delivered through locally established enterprises

incorporate the 2008 changes in the SNA and this manual.

tional Enterprises). For more details, see MSITS, Chap-
ter II, Conceptual Framework for the Development of
Statistics on International Trade in Services.

2. Classification

10.61 An overview of the classification of services
is shown in Table 10.1. The classification is mainly
product-based, but is transactor-based for travel, con-
struction, and government goods and services n.i.e. The
classification is according to the type of service, rather
than the unit that provides it; for example, if a bank pro-
vides pension fund services as a secondary activity, the
service is classified as pension fund services. A recon-
ciliation of the CPC and services classification is given
in MSITS. The detailed listing of CPC items included
in each service item in MSITS can be used to classify
any services not specified in the following text to the
appropriate international accounts service item.

a. Manufacturing services on physical inputs
owned by others

10.62 Manufacturing services on physical inputs
owned by others cover processing, assembly, labeling,
packing, and so forth undertaken by enterprises that

do not own the goods concerned. The manufacturing
is undertaken by an entity that does not own the goods
and that is paid a fee by the owner. In these cases, the
ownership of the goods does not change, so no general
merchandise transaction is recorded between the pro-
cessor and the owner.
10.63 Examples of processes that are often under-
taken under arrangements for manufacturing services
on physical inputs owned by others include oil refining,
liquefaction of natural gas, assembly of clothing and
electronics, assembly (excluding assembly of prefab-
ricated constructions, which are included in construc-
tion), labeling, and packing (excluding those incidental
to transport, which are included in transport services).
10.64 Manufacturing services on physical inputs
owned by others cover the transaction between the
owner and processor, and only the fee charged by the
processor is included under this item. The fee charged
may cover the cost of materials purchased by the proces-
sor. Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned
by others refer to all work done on goods by a resident
of one economy for the owner of goods who is resident
in another economy; the treatment of these services
is not conditional on whether the goods were previ-
ously or subsequently in the physical possession of the

is not necessary if data are sourced from international merchandise trade on a general trade basis.

owner or not. (Box 10.1 contrasts the entries for goods
under processing with those for goods under merchant-
ing. Box 10.2 discusses different types of arrangements
used for global manufacturing.)

Recording of related purchases and sales of goods
10.65 Purchases of materials by the owner (i.e.,
goods to be processed) may be obtained from residents
of the same economy as the owner, the same economy
as the processor, or a third economy. The treatment is
as follows:

(a) when the goods are acquired from residents of
the same economy as the owner, there is no inter-
national transaction; and
(b) when the goods are acquired from residents of
the same economy as the processor or a third
economy, the owner of the goods to be processed
records imports of general merchandise. (See
also paragraph 10.42 for circumstances in which
the sale could be recorded under merchanting.)
10.66 Sales of finished goods (i.e., goods after pro-
cessing) are treated as follows:

(a) when the goods are sold to residents of the same
economy as the owner, there is no international
transaction; and
(b) when the goods are sold to residents of the same
economy as the processor or a third economy,
the owner of the goods under processing records
the sale as exports of general merchandise. (The
seller could report merchanting in the case of
minor processing; see paragraph 10.42.)
Recording of related goods movements
10.67 The gross values of goods associated with
processing services can be identified as supplementary
items in economies where they are significant. Whereas
the manufacturing service is consistent with what is
recorded in business accounts and actual transactions,
the gross values of the physical movements of goods
without a change of ownership are useful for analysis
of processing activities. Values of the following items
may be identified:
(a) for customers of manufacturing services on goods
processed abroad (with no change of ownership
to the processor):
goods supplied for processing (goods sent);
and
goods dispatched after processing (goods
returned);
(b) for providers of manufacturing services on goods
processed in the compiling economy (with no
change of ownership to the processor):
goods received for processing (goods received);
and
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

With the trend toward a more globalized economy, there has been growth in cross-border
production arrangements. These arrangements involve different aspects of production pro-
cesses being partly or wholly undertaken by affiliates or outsourced to unrelated entities.
There are several types of arrangements, such as:
(a) Re-exports. Re-exports can be very significant in economies that are international
centers for trading, transshipment, and processing that does not change the physical
form of the goods (such as packing and labeling). (See paragraphs 10.37–10.39.)
(b) Goods under merchanting. While sometimes used for simple wholesaling, merchant-
ing also arises when parent companies acquire ownership of goods from their own
manufacturing affiliates for resale to wholesaling affiliates or other customers,
without taking possession. (See paragraphs 10.41–10.49.)
(c) Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by others and the associated
movements of goods under these processing arrangements. (See paragraphs 10.62–
10.71.)
(d) Free trade and other special zones. (See paragraphs 4.4 and 4.8.)
For economies where some or all of these arrangements are significant, it may be useful
to use supplementary presentations that bring these processes together and/or provide more
detail, such as presenting gross flows by type of activity, in order to enhance knowledge of
economic developments.
Box 10.2. Recording of Global Manufacturing Arrangements
goods dispatched after processing (goods sent).
10.68 A market-equivalent valuation for goods sup-
plied or received might be required. Gross values of the
goods are shown after processing, and again a market-
equivalent valuation might be required. The value of
goods input and dispatched could be reported either by
the customer or supplier of manufacturing services, or
from customs data:
If the values are reported by the customers, cover-
age should be irrespective of whether the input
goods were supplied by the owner from the own-
er’s territory, the processor’s territory, or a third
territory; or whether the goods are dispatched to
the owner’s territory, the processor’s territory, or
a third territory.
If reported from customs, coverage may be incom-
plete to the extent that some inputs and some pro-
cessed goods provided by the owner do not pass
through customs. For example, goods sourced or
sold locally will not be covered. Additionally, cus-
toms may not separately identify goods as being
subject to processing, such as if there are no duty
concessions.
There may be interest in breaking down these values by
product or product groups.

10.69 Transport costs may be incurred on move-
ments on goods undergoing processing. How these
transport services are recorded is determined from the
following factors:

(a) for goods included in general merchandise (i.e., in
the cases mentioned in paragraphs 10.65–10.66),
general principles for FOB valuation apply, so
that transport costs up to the customs frontier
are treated as being payable by the exporter and
transport costs after the frontier are treated as
payable by the importer; and
(b) for goods not included in general merchandise
(such as materials delivered from the owner to
the processor with no change of ownership),
transport costs are shown as payable according
to the arrangements of the parties; that is, the
amount is payable by the party invoiced to pay
the expense.
Other issues related to processing
10.70 The value of manufacturing services on physi-
cal inputs owned by others is not necessarily the same
as the difference between the value of goods sent for

processing and the value of goods after processing.
Possible causes include holding gains or losses, the
inclusion of overheads (such as financing, marketing,
and know-how included in the finished good price),
and measurement errors associated with the valuation
of goods movements where there is no sale.
10.71 In contrast to manufacturing services on phys-
ical inputs owned by others, manufacturing of goods on
own account means that the processor acquires owner-
ship of the goods. When ownership is acquired from a
nonresident, the gross values of the sale and purchase
of these goods are included in general merchandise.
Manufacturing on own account and manufacturing ser-
vices on physical inputs owned by others are different
arrangements for manufacturing, and it is desirable to
show them separately because the role of the manufac-
turer in designing, marketing, and financing the goods
is quite different. With globalization and outsourcing,
it is becoming more common to have parts of a produc-
tion process conducted in different economies. Show-
ing these transactions on a change of ownership basis
assists in identifying actual transactions and correctly
attributing value added due to the owner for designing,
marketing, financing, and so forth, rather than to the
party that undertakes physical processes.
b. Maintenance and repair services n.i.e.
10.72 Maintenance and repair services n.i.e. cover
maintenance and repair work by residents on goods
that are owned by nonresidents (and vice versa). The
repairs may be performed at the site of the repairer or
elsewhere. Repairs and maintenance on ships, aircraft,
and other transport equipment are included in this item.
Cleaning of transport equipment is included in trans-
port services. Construction maintenance and repairs
are excluded; they are included under construction.
Maintenance and repairs of computers are included
under computer services.
10.73 The value recorded for maintenance and repairs
is the value of the work done—not the gross value of the
goods before and after repairs. The value of maintenance
and repairs includes any parts or materials supplied by
the repairer and included in the charge. (Parts and mate-
rials charged separately should be included in general
merchandise.) As noted in paragraph 10.22, goods leav-
ing from, arriving in, and returning to a territory for
repair, processing, or other activity without a change
of ownership are excluded from general merchandise.
Maintenance and repair services n.i.e. cover both minor
repairs that maintain the good in working order and
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
major repairs that extend the efficiency or capacity of the
good or extend its life. No distinction is made between
those repairs included by the customer in intermediate
consumption and those in capital formation.

c. Transport

10.74 Transport is the process of carriage of peo-
ple and objects from one location to another as well
as related supporting and auxiliary services. Also
included are postal and courier services. Transport
can be classified according to:

(a) mode of transport, namely, sea, air, or other
(“other” may be further broken down into rail,
road, internal waterway, pipeline, and space trans-
port as well as electricity transmission); and
(b) what is carried—passengers or freight.
In the standard components, transport is classified
according to both dimensions. A breakdown of total
transport services into freight transport, passenger
transport, and other transport alone is proposed as sim-
plified standard components for those countries that are
unable (e.g., for reasons of confidentiality) to provide
the full breakdown by mode of transport.

10.75 A transport provider may subcontract to use
the services of other operators to provide part of the
final transport service. Such services should be recorded
on a gross basis. For example, a courier service pro-
vider might contract separately to more than one trans-
port operator. Any commissions payable by providers
of transport services to an agent should be separately
recorded, as described for travel in paragraph 10.98.

Passenger services
10.76 Passenger services cover the transport of
people. The category covers all services provided in
the international transport of nonresidents by resident
carriers (credit) and that of residents by nonresident
carriers (debit). Also included are passenger services
performed within a territory by nonresident carriers.
The valuation of passenger transport should include
fees payable by the carriers to travel agencies and other
providers of reservation services. Passenger services
provided within a territory by residents to nonresidents
and provided or purchased separately from interna-
tional transport are excluded from passenger transport;
these services are included in travel.

10.77 Passenger services include fares and other
expenditure related to the carriage of passengers. They

also include any taxes levied on passenger services,
such as sales or value-added taxes. Passenger services
include fares that are a part of package tours. Cruise
fares are included in travel. Passenger services include
such items as charges for excess baggage, vehicles, or
other personal accompanying effects and food, drink, or
other items purchased on board carriers. Also included
in passenger services are rentals, charters, and leases of
vessels, aircraft, coaches, or other commercial vehicles
with crews for the carriage of passengers. Excluded are
rentals or charters that are financial leases (included
in loans), and rentals and time charters without crew
(included in operating leasing services).
Freight services
10.78 Freight services cover the transport of objects
other than people. The treatment of freight services is
a consequence of adopting FOB as the uniform valu-
ation principle for goods. As discussed in paragraphs
10.31–10.34, FOB valuation is as at the customs frontier
of the exporting economy, so:
(a) all freight costs up to the customs frontier are
shown as incurred by the exporter, and
(b) all freight costs beyond the customs frontier are
shown as incurred by the importer.
In addition to freight on exports and imports, freight
transport services may relate to goods where there is no
change of ownership, such as goods sent for storage or
processing and migrants’ personal effects.
10.79 When actual arrangements for paying freight
costs differ from FOB terms of delivery, rerouting is
needed, as defined in paragraph 3.16. Rerouting of freight
services may mean that a transaction that is actually
between two residents is treated as a transaction between
a resident and a nonresident, and vice versa, as shown in
Box 10.3. The timing of the provision of freight services
may differ from the timing of the change of ownership of
those goods, such as goods sent abroad on consignment
where the sale occurs in a different accounting period
from when the goods crossed the exporter’s customs
frontier. In principle, freight services should be recorded
in the period they are rendered but are attributed to the
importer in the period when the goods are purchased.
However, in practice, the aggregated nature of record-
ing of freight services and lack of information on indi-
vidual freight movements means that timing adjustments
to deal with this issue may not be feasible, material, or
appropriate (e.g., if the importer pays for the service in
the period it is rendered).
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Other transport services
10.80 Other transport services include services
that are auxiliary to transport and not directly pro-
vided for the movement of goods and persons. The
category includes cargo handling charges billed
separately from freight, storage and warehousing,
packing and repackaging, towing not included in
freight services, pilotage and navigational aid for
carriers, air traffic control, cleaning performed in
ports and airports on transport equipment, salvage
operations, and agents’ fees associated with passen-
ger and freight transport (e.g., freight forwarding and
brokerage services).

10.81 Some related activities are excluded from
transport: freight insurance (included in insurance
services); goods procured in ports by nonresident
carriers (included in goods); maintenance and repairs
on transport equipment (included in maintenance
and repair services n.i.e.); and repairs of railway
facilities, harbors, and airfield facilities (included in
construction).
Postal and courier services
10.82 Postal and courier services cover the pick-up,
transport, and delivery of letters, newspapers, peri-
odicals, brochures, other printed matter, parcels, and
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
A piece of equipment costs 10,000 units at the factory
at which it was produced in Economy A. It costs 200 to
transport it to the customs frontier of Economy A, 300 to
transport it from the customs frontier of Economy A to the
customs frontier of Economy B, where a customs duty of
50 is levied, and it costs 100 to deliver it from the customs
frontier to the customer. (For simplicity, insurance of the
equipment during transport is not covered in the example.)
Under all contractual arrangements between the par-
ties, the FOB value is 10,200 and the CIF value is 10,500.
However, how the services are recorded depends on the
arrangements for paying the transport costs and the resi-
dence of the transport provider. A few of the possible
arrangements are discussed below:
Example 1:
The parties contract on an FOB basis (i.e., the invoice
price is 10,200; the exporter is responsible for costs up
to the frontier of A and the importer is responsible for
subsequent costs). In this case, no rerouting needed. All
freight is shown as being provided by the actual provider
and payable by the actual invoiced party.
Example 2:
The parties contract on an “ex works” basis (i.e., the
invoice price is 10,000; the buyer pays for transport from
the seller’s premises).
The freight from the factory to the customs frontier of
Economy A is provided by a resident of Economy A.
The 200 payable, which is actually a service provided
by a resident of Economy A and payable by a resident
of Economy B, must be rerouted to be shown as a
resident-to-resident transaction within A, as all costs
up to the frontier of the exporting economy are treated
as being payable by the exporter and included in the
price of the goods.
The freight from the factory to the customs frontier of
Economy A is provided by a resident of Economy B.
The 200 payable, which is actually a domestic service
transaction within Economy B, must be rerouted as
being a service provided from B to A, as all costs up
to the frontier of the exporting economy are treated as
being payable by the exporter.
Example 3:
The parties contract on a CIF basis (i.e., the invoice
price is 10,500). The 300 payable for freight from the
customs frontier of Economy A to that of Economy B is
rerouted, because the contract makes it payable by the
exporter, but it is treated as payable by the importer in
balance of payments statistics (i.e., following FOB valu-
ation). As a result, if the freight provider is a resident of
A, a domestic transaction within A is treated as being a
balance of payments transaction. Conversely, if the freight
provider is a resident of B, an international transaction is
treated as being a domestic transaction within B.
It is not normally possible to study every contract, so
general patterns of freight cost arrangements need to be
identified. When contract terms other than FOB are used,
actual payment arrangements for freight may need adjust-
ments to meet the FOB valuation convention.
In all cases where apparently domestic transactions are
rerouted to be recorded as international transactions, or
vice versa, goods trade must be recorded on a consistent
basis, so that the financial payment from B to A equals
the sum of its goods and services imports, both before and
after re-routing adjustments. (If the goods are recorded
at FOB values, the adjustments to freight bring them
into consistency with goods; if the goods are recorded
at transaction values, the goods values need correspond-
ing adjustments.) Rentals, charters, or operating leases of
vessels, aircraft, freight cars, or other commercial vehi-
cles with crews for the carriage of freight are included in
freight services. Also included are towing and services
related to the transport of oil platforms, floating cranes,
and dredges. Financial leases of transport equipment are
excluded from transport services (see paragraphs 5.56–
5.59 and 10.17(f)).
Box 10.3. Numerical Examples of the Treatment of Freight Services
packages, including post office counter and mailbox
rental services.

10.83 Postal services also include post office coun-
ter services, such as sales of stamps and money orders,
poste restante services, telegram services, and so forth.
Excluded are financial services rendered by postal
administration entities, such as postal giro, banking
and savings account services (recorded under financial
services), mail preparation services (recorded under
other business services), and administration services
related to postal communication systems (included in
telecommunication services). Postal services are sub-
ject to international agreements, and the service entries
between operators of different economies should be
recorded on a gross basis. Postal services provided to
travelers are included in travel.

10.84 Courier services include express and door-to-
door delivery. Express delivery services might include,
for example, on-demand pick-up or time-definite deliv-
ery. Excluded are the movement of mail carried by
air transport enterprises (recorded under transport, air,
freight), storage of goods (recorded under transport,
other, auxiliary and supporting services), and mail
preparation services (recorded under other business
services, other).

10.85 The principles for recording postal and cou-
rier services on exports and imports of merchandise
are the same as for other freight services, as discussed
in Box 10.3. This treatment is a consequence of the
FOB valuation of the goods concerned. The princi-
ples for recording postal and courier services on other
items, such as documents, personal effects, and goods
for repair, are that the service is payable by the party
responsible for payment. Courier services may encom-
pass combinations of road, sea, air, and other methods
of transport.

d. Travel

10.86 Travel credits cover goods and services for
own use or to give away acquired from an economy
by nonresidents during visits to that economy. Travel
debits cover goods and services for own use or to give
away acquired from other economies by residents dur-
ing visits to these other economies. The goods and
services may be purchased by the persons concerned
or by another party on their behalf. For example, busi-
ness travel may be paid or reimbursed by an employer,
tuition and living costs of a student may be paid by a
government, or health costs may be paid or reimbursed
by a government or insurer. Goods and services sup-

plied by the producer without charge are also included,
such as tuition and board provided by a university.
10.87 The standard component breakdown of travel
is between business and personal travel, with supple-
mentary data for groups of special interest, such as bor-
der, seasonal, and other short-term workers. A separate
supplementary breakdown of travel into types of goods
and services is suggested (see paragraph 10.95).
10.88 Unlike most other service categories, travel
is not a specific type of service, but a transactor-based
component that covers an assortment of goods and ser-
vices. In the case of travel, the consumer moves to
another territory to consume the goods and services
that he or she acquires. For these reasons, travel is not
identified as a service in the CPC. Goods and services
provided to visitors while on their trips that would oth-
erwise be classified under another item such as postal
services, telecommunications, local transport, hire of
equipment, or gambling are included under travel.
10.89 Goods or services acquired by persons under-
taking study or medical care while outside their terri-
tory of residence are included in travel. Acquisitions
of goods and services by border, seasonal, and other
short-term cross-border workers in their economy of
employment are also included in travel.^9 Acquisitions
of goods and services by diplomats, consular staff, mil-
itary personnel, and so forth and their dependents (but
not locally engaged staff and their dependents) in the
territory in which they are posted are included under
government goods and services n.i.e.
10.90 Travel excludes goods for resale, which are
included in general merchandise. The acquisition of
valuables (such as jewelry), consumer durable goods
(such as cars and electric goods), and other consumer
purchases for own use or to give away that are included
in customs data in excess of customs thresholds is
included in general merchandise. (The inclusion of these
goods in general merchandise is discussed in paragraph
10.18.) Valuables and consumer durables that have not
been included in general merchandise data should be
included in travel (e.g., locally acquired goods kept
in a vacation home). Travel includes local transport
(i.e., transport within the economy being visited and
provided by a resident of that economy), but excludes
international transport (which is included in passenger
transport; see paragraph 10.76).
(^9) These acquisitions are not considered as tourism expenditure,
so showing them separately as supplementary items allows travel
data from the balance of payments to be reconciled with tourism
statistics.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Business travel
10.91 Business travel covers goods and services
acquired for personal use by persons whose primary
purpose of travel is for business. Examples include
the expenditure of carrier crews stopping off or lay-
ing over; government employees on official travel;
employees of international organizations on offi-
cial business; employees traveling on behalf of their
employer (except for diplomatic staff, etc., employed
in government enclaves, whose expenditure in their
territory of physical location is included in government
goods and services n.i.e., as discussed in paragraph
10.178); self-employed nonresidents traveling for busi-
ness purposes; and seasonal, border, and other short-
term workers who are not resident in the economy in
which they are employed. The business activities may
include production or installation work, sales cam-
paigns, market exploration, commercial negotiations,
missions, conference, conventions, other meetings, or
other business purposes on behalf of an enterprise
resident in another economy.

10.92 Business travel includes the goods and ser-
vices acquired for personal use by persons whose
main purpose of travel is for business (including
goods and services for which business travelers are
reimbursed by employers) but not the sales or pur-
chases that they may conclude on behalf of the enter-
prises they represent.

10.93 A supplementary item may be provided to
show the total credits and debits for acquisition of goods
and services by border, seasonal, and other short-term
workers.

Personal travel
10.94 Personal travel covers goods and services
acquired by persons going abroad for purposes other
than business, such as vacations, participation in rec-
reational and cultural activities, visits with friends
and relatives, pilgrimage, and education- and health-
related purposes. Where important, there may be sup-
plementary items to break down personal travel into
subcomponents:

(a) health-related (e.g., medical services, other
health care, food, accommodation, local trans-
port, acquired by those traveling for medical
reasons);
(b) education-related (e.g., tuition, food, accommo-
dation, local transport, health services, acquired
by nonresident students); and
(c) all other personal travel. (This component
includes health expenditure by those not travel-
ing for health or educational purposes.)
The residence of international patients and students is
discussed in paragraphs 4.120–4.121. Health and edu-
cational services not included in travel are discussed in
paragraph 10.167.
Other issues related to travel
10.95 A separate supplementary breakdown of travel
may be provided according to product group, namely:
(a) goods,
(b) local transport services,
(c) accommodation services,
(d) food-serving services, and
(e) other services.
This breakdown allows for closer links with tourism
satellite accounts as well as supply and use tables.
Further information on tourism statistics is presented
in United Nations, Tourism Satellite Account: Rec-
ommended Methodological Framework^10 and United
Nations World Tourism Organization, International
Recommendations for Tourism Statistics. To highlight
the link between travel and passenger transport ser-
vices and tourism statistics, an approximation to tour-
ism expenditure may be shown as a supplementary item
that identifies relevant tourism-related goods and ser- identifies relevant tourism-related goods and ser-tourism-related goods and ser-
vices in the travel and passenger transport items.passenger transport items.^11
10.96 Travel covers stays of any length provided there
is no change of residence. (Principles for determining
residence of households are shown in paragraphs 4.116–
4.130.) In some cases, it may be useful to break down
travel by length of stay. For example, expenditure of
those who do not remain overnight may be shown on a
supplementary basis if this is significant.
10.97 In line with the accrual principle, goods and
services acquired during the visit but paid for earlier or
later are included in travel. Goods and services may be
(^10) The tourism satellite account has the concept of usual environ-
ment as an additional criterion to that of residence. As a result,
acquisitions of goods and services by border, seasonal, and other
short-term cross-border workers in their economy of employment
can be identified separately in travel for compatibility with tourism
statistics.
(^11) This supplementary item includes all personal travel and that
part of business travel that does not cover expenditure of border,
seasonal, and other short-term workers, as well as passenger trans-
port services.
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account

acquired by being paid for by the person going abroad,
paid for on his or her behalf, or provided without a quid
pro quo (e.g., free room and board received, in such case
there is also a corresponding transfer), or produced on
own account (as in some cases of notional units for own-
ership of real estate and time-share accommodation).

10.98 Travel services may be arranged through a
travel agent, tour operator, time-share exchange agent,
or other provider. In some of these cases, the agent may
pay the travel providers an amount that deducts a mar-
gin or commission. If the agent is a resident of the same
economy as the customer, then the margin or commis-
sion is a resident-to-resident transaction, and the net
amount payable to service providers resident in other
economies (after the margin or commission receivable
by the agent is deducted) is included in travel. In other
cases, the nonresident provider of the services may pay
the resident agent’s commission and the gross amount
is payable by the customer to nonresidents, and thus is
included in travel. Fares for cruises provided by opera-
tors resident in economies other than that of the passen-
ger are included in travel (not passenger transport).

10.99 In the case of a nonresident owner of land and
buildings, any accommodation services provided by
the identified notional unit to its owner (see paragraph
4.36) are shown in travel.

10.100 The term “time-share” covers a wide range
of arrangements. They can be classified in the three
categories, as described in Table 10.3:
(a) The acquisition of deeded ownership, or a similar
arrangement, is equivalent to the acquisition of
a notional direct investment enterprise. In this
case, after deeded ownership is acquired, accom-
modation services provided to the owner should
be imputed based on market prices, which in
turn gives rise to direct investment income on
equity. (An example of a similar arrangement is
a long-term lease that is of such duration that it
represents an effective change in ownership.)
(b) Payments for rights to use a property under a
membership system time-sharing arrangement,
where the right to use the time share is not trans-
ferable (the third category shown in the table),
is equivalent to prepaying for accommodation
services (recorded in trade credit and advances).
After initial acquisition, the prepayment is drawn
down, and imputed accommodation services
should be recorded in travel.
(c) A “right to use” time-share arrangement that
carries a transferable right should be accounted
for as prepaying for accommodation services
(recorded in trade credit and advances), identical

credit and advances (reflecting the value of the
remaining prepaid accommodation services)

duced nonfinancial asset, in the capital account.
e. Construction

10.101 Construction covers the creation, renovation,
repair, or extension of fixed assets in the form of build-
ings, land improvements of an engineering nature, and
other such engineering constructions as roads, bridges,
dams, and so forth. It also includes related installation
and assembly work. It includes site preparation and gen-
eral construction as well as specialized services such as
painting, plumbing, and demolition. It also includes
management of construction projects.

10.102 Acquisition of goods and services by the
enterprises undertaking that construction work from
the economy of location of the construction work is
also recorded under construction. Goods and services
provided from the home economy are resident-to-
resident transactions, and so should be excluded (see
also paragraph 10.22). Goods and services acquired
from third economies (i.e., neither the residence of
the enterprise, nor the location of the construction
work) are recorded under the appropriate general
merchandise or service item for the economy of the
enterprise.

10.103 If the external operations of a construc-
tion enterprise are substantial enough, they constitute
a branch resident in the economy of operations (see
paragraphs 4.27–4.29). Therefore, a large-scale con-
struction project contracted by a nonresident enterprise
that takes a year or more to complete will usually give
rise to a resident branch. Accordingly, there would be
a direct investment relationship between the parent and
the branch; there may also be goods and services sup-
plied between the branch and the parent, such as for
materials. As a result of this treatment, the construction
contracts covered in international trade in services are
generally of a short-term nature.

10.104 Construction can be disaggregated into con-
struction abroad and construction in the compiling
economy. This disaggregation allows for the recording
on a gross basis of both the construction work under-
taken and the goods and services acquired from the
economy in which the construction activity is being

undertaken by the nonresident enterprise that under-
takes the construction.
Construction abroad
10.105 Construction abroad consists of:
(a) construction work for nonresidents by enterprises
resident in the compiling economy (credit), and
(b) the goods and services acquired from the econ-
omy in which the construction activity is being
undertaken by these enterprises (debit).
Construction in the compiling economy
10.106 Construction in the compiling economy con-
sists of
(a) construction work for residents of the compiling
economy by nonresident construction enterprises
(debit), and
(b) the goods and services acquired in the compiling
economy from resident enterprises by these non-
resident construction enterprises (credit).
Valuat ion
10.107 Construction is valued on a gross basis—that
is, inclusive of all goods and services provided by the
construction contractor as inputs to the work, and also
inclusive of other costs of production and the operating
surplus that accrues to the construction contractor. The
transfer of ownership of construction under a contract
may be deemed to occur in stages as value is put in place.
In such cases, stage payments made by the owner can
often be used to approximate the value of the gross fixed
capital formation although stage payments may some-
times be made in advance or in arrears of the comple-
tion of the stage, in which case advances or trade credit
are also extended. Construction can be undertaken in a
similar way to manufacturing services on physical inputs
owned by others. That is, a customer may provide goods
and services as inputs to a construction project but the
goods and services do not change ownership to the con-
struction contractor. In such cases, the treatment, as with
manufacturing services, is to record actual changes of
ownership, not physical movements of goods. Repairs on
embassies, bases, and so forth owned by the government
that occupies them are included in government goods
and services n.i.e. (see paragraph 10.177).
Existing buildings
10.108 As noted in paragraph 4.34, because of the
imputation of notional units for ownership of land, most
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
transactions involving acquisitions of existing build-
ings and land are treated as being between two resi-
dent units. International transactions of construction
can arise when a building for an embassy, consulate,
military base, or international organization changes
hands with a resident of the economy in which the
building is physically located. The ownership could
change because of a sale or gift. Transactions in con-
struction may also occur for buildings in an area that
is exchanged between economies (see paragraph 4.9).
The change in ownership of the land component is
shown in the capital account (see paragraph 13.10);
separate estimates should be made for the structure
and land components. Transactions in existing build-
ings are included in construction in the same way as
new buildings, to avoid having to distinguish new and
existing buildings, and this treatment is analogous to
the treatment in merchandise trade where both new and
second-hand equipment are combined.

f. Insurance and pension services

10.109 Insurance and pension services include ser-
vices of providing life insurance and annuities, non-
life insurance, reinsurance, freight insurance, pensions,
standardized guarantees, and auxiliary services to
insurance, pension schemes, and standardized guaran-
tee schemes. More information on insurance and pen-
sions is provided in Appendix 6c.

10.110 The processes undertaken by insurers and
pension funds include charging premiums, paying
claims, and investing funds. To analyze the underlying
economic nature of these operations, it is necessary to
rearrange these processes to identify separately the ser-
vice element. Appendix 6c provides some background
to the way insurance and pension schemes operate and
the value of their services is calculated. The usual start-
ing point for deriving the exported and imported com-
ponents is the value of premiums and claims, which are
observable, rather than derived.

10.111 In overview, the total value of insurance and
pension services is derived as the margin between the
amounts accruing to the companies (namely, premi-
ums, contributions, and supplements) and the amounts
accruing to the policyholders (namely, claims and ben-
efits). That is, for nonlife insurance, the value of output
of nonlife insurance services can be expressed with the
following formula:

Gross premiums earned;
+ Premium supplements;
Claims payable plus adjustment for claims vola-
tility, if necessary.
More elaboration is provided in Appendix 6c: nonlife
insurance (paragraphs A6c.16–A6c.22), reinsurance
(paragraph A6c.23), life insurance (paragraph A6c.31),
and pension schemes (paragraph A6c.40).
10.112 The supplementary breakdown of insurance
and pension services is between direct insurance, rein-
surance, auxiliary insurance services, and pension and
standardized guarantee services. In addition, data on
gross premiums earned (see paragraph A6c.17) and
unadjusted claims (claims payable before adjustments
for claims volatility; see paragraphs A6c.21–A6c.22)
may be provided as supplementary items, with separate
details on nonlife, life, pension, and standardized guar-
antee components, as considered appropriate.
10.113 For exports of nonlife insurance services,
the service charge can be estimated from total non-
life insurance output by multiplying the gross premi-
ums earned from nonresidents by the ratio of service
charge to gross premiums earned for all nonlife insur-
ance operations. (This calculation is illustrated in Box
10.4, Example 2.) The same prorating technique can
be used for life insurance, annuities, pension funds,
and standardized guarantees. To the extent that these
ratios vary for different lines of business (reinsur-
ance, marine, term life, etc.), the calculations should
be made separately. Similarly, if it is known that there
are different margins between resident and nonresident
customers, data from the operations most relevant to
nonresident policyholders should be used. The ratios
should be calculated according to the formula for out-
put in paragraph 10.111, so they take into account pre-
mium supplements and claims volatility. (See Box 10.4
for an example of calculations.)
10.114 For imports of nonlife insurance services,
the available information is less complete than that
for exports. For reinsurance, the only customers are
insurance companies, so data on premiums payable
and claims receivable may be readily available from
them. However, premium supplements are not observ-
able. For direct insurance, there is a wider range of
customers and, so, available data may be more lim-
ited, such as premiums paid and actual claims only.
To derive a service charge from these values, ratios
need to be obtained using the most suitable available
indicator:
(a) Ratios from other economies or from published
accounts of large international insurance com-
panies may be used. International trade in some
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

types of nonlife insurance is dominated by rela-
tively large, specialized companies;
(b) Ratios from the resident insurance industry may
be considered. In some economies, there may be
equivalent lines of business; or
(c) Ratios based on premiums payable abroad and
claims receivable from abroad over a medium- to
long-term period. International insurance trade
includes direct insurance of large items (like
ships and aircraft) and reinsurance, so claims
receivable for a particular economy may be
highly volatile. An adjustment for premium sup-
plements would also be needed, or there could be
an understatement of the value of services.
Such ratios should be calculated as consistently as pos-
sible with those for total services and exports outlined
above, so they would also take into account premium

supplements and claim volatility. Although premium
supplements are not readily observable for imports,
some adjustment is needed, or there would be an under-
statement of the value of services and asymmetry with
exports. Premium supplements to premiums ratios
observed from other cases could be used to avoid this
understatement. The same prorating techniques can be
used for life insurance, annuities, pension funds, and
standardized guarantee.
10.115 Data on reinsurance imports can be collected
from the policyholders, because they are all insurance
companies. The value of direct insurance service pro-
duced relates to the whole of the risk that is insured,
including any reinsured component. Thus, direct pre-
miums and claims are recorded gross of reinsurance.
10.116 Freight insurance is a form of nonlife insur-
ance that raises particular issues. Freight insurance pre-
miums payable on international traded goods before they

(This example is applicable to types of insurance not subject to fluctuations in claims; for
an example with an adjustment for claims volatility, see Appendix 6c.)
Example 1. For resident insurers with separate data on policyholders abroad:
Premiums earned from abroad 100 (premiums received 105)
Claims payable abroad 95 (claims paid 85)
Technical reserves relating to insurance with nonresidents 200 (beginning of period)
Income attributable to policyholders 20 (premium supplements)
The resulting entries are:
Services Insurance service charge = 25 (derived as 100 + 20 – 95)
Primary Income Income attributable to policyholders = 20
Current transfers Net premiums receivable = 95
(premiums plus supplements less service = 100 + 20 – 25)
Claims payable = 95 (actual; equal to net premiums receivable
if no adjustment of claims for volatility)

Premiums from residents 40

Nonlife Insurance Services
reach the customs frontier of the economy of the exporter
are included in the FOB price of the good. Freight insur-
ance premiums payable subsequent to the goods leav-
ing the customs frontier of the exporter’s economy are
treated as payable by the importer. When the parties
have not arranged the payment of insurance premiums
in the same way as this methodology, partitioning and
rerouting are needed (see paragraphs 3.16–3.17). These
adjustments are of the same nature as those discussed for
freight services. The service elements for freight insur-
ance can be derived in the same way as other insurance.

10.117 Auxiliary insurance services consist of the
provision of services that are closely related to insur-
ance and pension fund operations. Included are agents’
commissions, insurance brokering and agency services,
insurance and pension consultancy services, evaluation
and loss adjustment services, actuarial services, salvage
administration services, and regulatory and monitoring
services on indemnities and recovery services. These
services are charged through explicit charges.

g. Financial services

10.118 Financial services cover financial interme-
diary and auxiliary services, except insurance and
pension fund services. These services include those
usually provided by banks and other financial corpora-
tions. They include deposit taking and lending, letters
of credit, credit card services, commissions and charges
related to financial leasing, factoring, underwriting,
and clearing of payments. Also included are financial
advisory services, custody of financial assets or bul-
lion, financial asset management, monitoring services,
liquidity provision services, risk assumption services
other than insurance, merger and acquisition services,
credit rating services, stock exchange services, and
trust services.

10.119 Financial services may be charged for by:
(a) explicit charges;
(b) margins on buying and selling transactions;
(c) asset management costs deducted from property
income receivable in the case of asset-holding
entities; or
(d) margins between interest payable and the refer-
ence rate on loans and deposits (called financial
intermediation service charges indirectly mea-
sured, abbreviated as FISIM).
For financial intermediaries, the balance between explicit
and implicit charges may vary over time and from insti-

tution to institution, so data on both are needed to get a
complete picture of their supply of services.
Explicit charges
10.120 Services are charged for by explicit charges
in the case of many financial services and require no
special calculation. Some explicit charges associated
with deposit and lending services include application
and commitment fees, fees for one-off guarantees,
early or late repayment fees or penalties, and account
charges. (However, an increase in interest rates as a
result of late payment would not be classified as an
explicit fee, but would be included with other interest
and, so, taken into account as FISIM.)
10.121 Explicit charges also include commissions
and other fees related to letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances, lines of credit, financial leasing, money
transfer, and foreign exchange transactions. Also
included are commissions and other charges related
to transactions in securities: brokerage, placements of
issues, underwritings, and redemptions; commissions
and fees paid for the arrangement of financial deriva-
tive contracts; commissions of commodity futures trad-
ers; and asset management services, financial market
operational and regulatory services, security custody
services, and so forth.^12 Service charges on purchases
of IMF resources are included among an economy’s
financial service payments, as are charges (similar to
commitment fees) associated with undrawn balances
under stand-by or extended arrangements with the IMF.
Charges payable to a financial institution for arranging
the provision of financial resources, which are services,
should be distinguished from amounts payable to the
suppliers of financial resources for the use of these
resources (which are income; see paragraph 11.3(b)).
Margins on buying and selling transactions
10.122 Dealers or market-makers in financial instru-
ments may charge, in full or part, for their services by
having a spread between their buying and selling prices.
Dealers, market-makers, foreign exchange bureaus, and
other intermediaries producing this kind of service are
distinguished from other traders by the existence of a
buy-sell spread, which shows that they serve the market
(^12) Financial derivative transactions may take place directly
between two parties or through intermediaries. In the latter case,
there may be implicit or explicit service charges. It is not usually
possible to distinguish implicit service charges. Therefore, it is rec-
ommended that net settlement payments of derivative contracts be
recorded as financial transactions. However, when possible, service
charge components should be recorded separately.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

in a somewhat similar way to a wholesaler, by provid-
ing liquidity and inventory. Foreign exchange, shares,
bonds, notes, financial derivatives, and other financial
instruments are often bought and sold in this way.

10.123 The dealers’ service charges are included
indistinguishably in the financial transactions to which
they relate. In such cases, the difference between the
reference price and the dealer’s buying price at the time
of purchase represents the service charge to the seller.
Similarly, the difference between the reference price
and the dealer’s selling price at the time of sale rep-
resents the value of the service provided to the buyer.
The reference price is usually a mid-price between the
buying and selling prices; some dealers may have their
own internal price for determining their buying and
selling prices. In contrast to the reference price, the
prices actually paid or received include the financial
service component. By using the reference price at the
time of purchase or sale, any holding gains or losses on
the dealer’s trading activity are excluded from services.
The service can also be measured by applying the deal-
ers’ average margin as a percentage to the value of
transactions through dealers.

Asset management costs taken out of income
10.124 Some institutional units have the sole or pre-
dominant function of holding financial assets on behalf
of their owners. For example, some mutual funds,
holding companies, trusts, and special purpose entities
serve this purpose. In the process of managing those
assets, these enterprises incur administrative expenses,
such as payments to fund managers, custodians, banks,
accountants, lawyers, or their own staff. The expenses
can be charged for explicitly as a fee, or implicitly by
being paid out of investment income received or out
of the assets of the enterprise. The expenses implic-
itly paid for should be recognized as a service to the
owners. For example, a hedge fund may distribute a
proportion of the net income of the fund to the entity
that manages the fund, which should be recorded as a
charge for services. Similarly, a custodian may charge
lower fees in exchange for the right to on-lend securities
(the income from on-lending securities is discussed in
paragraphs 11.67–11.68).

10.125 Implicit asset management service charges
can be measured at cost. The corresponding entry is
to increase the net value of investment income payable
to the investor to the gross value before deduction of
the expenses. Without the recognition of the output of
such services, the costs incurred would lead to negative

operating surplus for the asset management enterprises.
With this treatment, these enterprises have a net operat-
ing surplus of zero.
FISIM
10.126 Actual interest can be seen as including both
an income element and a charge for a service. Lenders
and deposit-takers operate by offering rates of interest
to their depositors that are lower than the rates that they
charge to their borrowers. The resulting interest mar-
gins are used by the financial corporations to defray
their expenses and to provide an operating surplus.
Interest margins are an alternative to charging cus-
tomers explicitly for financial services. In addition to
financial intermediation, where funds are taken in as
deposits and loaned, lending of own funds can give rise
to FISIM in the cases of money lenders and loans made
from banks’ own funds.
10.127 By convention, these indirect charges in
respect of interest apply only to loans and deposits and
only when those loans and deposits are provided by,
or deposited with, financial corporations (as defined
in paragraph 4.63). While loans by holding compa-
nies, special purpose entities, and other captive finan-
cial institutions to their affiliates are not normally
expected to generate FISIM, they may do so if they
charge a margin. Financial corporations may generate
FISIM even if they have only loans or only deposits;
for instance, a credit card issuer that raises all of its
funds by debt securities can earn FISIM on its loans
to credit card customers.
10.128 The rate of FISIM may vary owing to a range
of factors, such as the accessibility of funds, services
included such as arrangements for check-writing facili-
ties (for deposits), perceptions of the credit risk of the
borrower, and the collateral provided (for loans). Addi-
tionally, large-scale (“wholesale”) loans and deposits
tend to have lower rates of FISIM than small-scale
(“retail”) loans and deposits.
10.129 FISIM payable by each of the depositors and
borrowers are calculated by using the concept of a “ref-
erence” rate of interest. The reference rate should con-
tain no service element and reflect the risk and maturity
structure of deposits and loans. The rate prevailing for
interbank borrowing and lending may be a suitable
choice as a reference rate. A single rate should be used
for transactions in the domestic currency, whereas dif-
ferent rates should be applied for loans and deposits in
other currencies. The reference rate will change over
time with market conditions.
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
10.130 For cross-border deposits and loans, different
currencies may be involved, so separate reference rates
should be applied for each currency that is a significant
proportion of loans or deposits. To be closest to the defini-
tion of the reference rate and for international symmetry of
recording, the rate should be taken from the financial mar-
kets of the home market of the currency, and preferably be
the same as used by statistical compilers in that economy.
(The data compiled for the currency composition in Tables
I-III of Appendix 9 can provide relevant information on
calculation of FISIM for each major currency.)

10.131 FISIM is calculated as follows:
(a) for loans from financial corporations—the dif-
ference between the interest actually payable on
loans and the amount that would be payable if
the reference rate were used, and
(b) for deposits with financial corporations—the
difference between the interest that would be
earned if a reference rate were used and the
interest actually earned.
(See Box 10.5 for a numerical example.)
10.132 Because a repo with supply of cash is treated
as involving a loan or deposit, as stated in paragraphs
5.52–5.53, it may give rise to FISIM. Similarly, a finan-
cial lease is treated as giving rise to a loan (see para-
graphs 5.56–5.58) so it may also give rise to FISIM if
provided by a financial corporation. Interbank loans
and deposits generally occur at or close to the reference
rate, in which case there is no FISIM. However, where
there are significant international interbank transac-
tions at interest rates above the reference rate (e.g., if
the debtor bank has a lower credit rating), it would be
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

The data requirements for the calculation of FISIM are:
(1) values of loans and deposits (available from the IIP);
(2) the corresponding interest payable/receivable (available from the primary income
account); and
(3) the applicable reference rate (usually available from central bank bulletins and other
publications).
In this example, all loans and deposits are denominated in domestic currency and are issued
by financial corporations. The interbank interest rate is 5 percent per annum.
Average value of loans during the year = 1000
Actual interest receivable by financial corporations on loans = 70
partitioned into:
50 pure interest receivable (derived as 1000 at 5 percent)
20 FISIM receivable (derived as 70 – 50)
Average value of deposits during the year = 500
Actual interest payable by financial corporations on deposits =10
partitioned into:
25 pure interest payable (derived as 500 at 5 percent)
15 FISIM receivable (derived as 25 – 10)
Total FISIM receivable by financial corporations = 35 (20+15)
—————
Notes:
The difference between interest receivable and payable is not the same as FISIM. In this example, the
difference is 25, which differs from the correct figure because the loan assets do not match the deposit
liabilities. (For example, an economy which had external loan assets funded entirely from domestic
sources, there would be zero interest payable, so the difference between international interest payable
and receivable is an unsuitable estimate of FISIM.) Unlike the reference rate concept, the method fails
to separate the services provided to depositors from those to borrowers, so it does not provide a basis to
identify the partner economy.
The average value of loans or deposits should be used in the calculation, as it corresponds to the amount
on which interest accrues. If values change significantly during the period, the use of an end-of-period
value as a proxy for the average may give an unsatisfactory result.
A more detailed calculation may take into account different currencies and maturities.
Box 10.5. Numerical Example of Calculation of FISIM
suitable for FISIM to be identified. See also paragraphs
11.74–11.75 on the effects of FISIM on interest.

10.133 Estimates of cross-border FISIM can be
calculated from data on the international investment
position or banking data on deposits and loans from
financial corporations in conjunction with the amounts
of actual interest payable and receivable and reference
interest rates. For economies where cross-border FISIM
is small, it can be measured with relatively simplified
methods based on aggregated data.

10.134 Negative FISIM may occur in reality (e.g.,
when loans are at fixed interest rates and market rates
rise). Negative FISIM can also occur owing to mea-
surement error. For example, some large international
transactions between banks may be at or near the refer-
ence rate, so a small error in measuring the reference
rate could cause negative FISIM.

10.135 The identification of FISIM as the finan-
cial service implicitly included in interest requires
corresponding adjustments to interest as recorded in
the primary income account. Actual interest payable
by borrowers is partitioned between a pure interest
charge at the reference rate (in primary income) and
FISIM (a service). Similarly, pure interest receivable
by depositors is calculated by applying the reference
rate to depositors, and depositors are shown as con-
suming a service equivalent to the difference between
the actual interest and interest at the reference rate.
The interest shown in the primary income accounts
is shown after adjusting for FISIM—“pure interest”;
also, there is a memorandum item for interest before
adjusting for FISIM—“actual interest” (see para-
g r aphs 11.74 –11.75).

10.136 Financial services exclude pure interest, div-
idends, life insurance and pension services, other insur-
ance services, nonfinancial advisory services provided
by banks (included under other business services), and
holding gains and losses on purchases and sales of
financial instruments.

h. Charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e.

10.137 Charges for the use of intellectual property
n.i.e. include:

(a) Charges for the use of proprietary rights (such
as patents, trademarks, copyrights, industrial
processes and designs including trade secrets,
franchises). These rights can arise from
research and development, as well as from mar-
keting; and
(b) Charges for licenses to reproduce or distribute
(or both) intellectual property embodied in pro-
duced originals or prototypes (such as copyrights
on books and manuscripts, computer software,
cinematographic works, and sound recordings)
and related rights (such as for live performances
and television, cable, or satellite broadcast).
(As shown in Table 10.4, some other kinds of intellec-
tual property are included in other categories.)
10.138 The production of books, recordings, films,
software, disks, and so forth is a two-stage process of
which the first stage is the production of the original
and the second stage the production and use of cop-
ies of the original. The output of the first stage is the
original itself over which legal or de facto ownership
can be established by copyright, patent, or secrecy.
The owner of the asset may use it directly to pro-
duce copies that give the purchaser a license to use.
Alternatively, the owner may issue a license to other
producers to reproduce and distribute the content.
The payments made by the licensee to the owner may
be described in various ways, such as fees, commis-
sions, or royalties. The treatment of flows relating
to intellectual property is summarized in Table 10.4.
In contrast to temporary rights to use, outright sales
of patents, copyrights, and industrial processes and
designs are included under research and development
services (discussed in paragraph 10.147). Similarly,
temporary rights for computer software and audio-
visual originals are treated differently from outright
sales (as shown in Table 10.4).
10.139 The time of recording of charges for the
use of intellectual property follows the substance of
the license agreement. If the rights to use intellectual
property are sold for a fixed fee, under a noncancel-
lable contract, and where the licensor has no remaining
obligations to perform, then the whole sum is a sale.
Otherwise charges are allocated over the life of the
agreement. In practice, it may be feasible to record the
payments only when they are made.
10.140 Franchise fees, trademark revenue, payments
for use of brand names, and so forth include aspects
of property income (i.e., putting a nonfinancial non-
produced asset at the disposal of another unit) as well
as aspects of services (such as the active processes
of technical support, product research, marketing, and
quality control). In principle, it would be desirable to
separate the income and service elements. However,
it may not generally be feasible to do so in practice;
in which case, a convention is adopted that the entire
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
values are to be classified as charges for the use of intel-
lectual property. Such a convention would be taken as a
starting point, but if additional information to make a
split is available, the compiler should do so.

i. Telecommunications, computer, and
information services

10.141 Computer and telecommunication services
are defined in terms of the nature of the service, not the
method of delivery.^13 To illustrate, provision of busi-
ness services, such as accounting services, is included
under the appropriate heading under other business
services, even if these services are entirely delivered
by telephone, computer, or the Internet. Only amounts
payable for transmission should be included under tele-
communications services; downloaded content should
be included in the appropriate item (computer, informa-
tion, audiovisual, etc., services).

(^13) However, the mode of delivery is taken into account in some
cases in the distinguishing between goods and services, as shown
in Table 10.4.
Telecommunications services
10.142 Telecommunications services encompass the
broadcast or transmission of sound, images, data, or
other information by telephone, telex, telegram, radio
and television cable transmission, radio and televi-
sion satellite, electronic mail, facsimile, and so forth,
including business network services, teleconferencing,
and support services. They do not include the value of
the information transported. Also included are mobile
telecommunications services, Internet backbone ser-
vices, and online access services, including provision
of access to the Internet. Excluded are installation ser-
vices for telephone network equipment (included in
construction) and database services (included in infor-
mation services).
Computer services
10.143 Computer services consist of hardware- and
software-related services and data-processing services.
Table 10.4 shows the classification of various arrange-
ments for software and other types of intellectual prop-
erty products. Computer services include:

(^1) Covers the case where a specific product is supplied with the right to use the intellectual property embodied in it, but not to copy it for further distribution.
The transactions should be classified under the appropriate goods and services items.
(^2) Covers the case where authority to reproduce and/or distribute the intellectual property is delegated by its owner.
(^3) Covers the case where there is a change of economic ownership of the whole of the intellectual property right in question.The seller no longer has any rights
or obligations associated with the intellectual property.This case also includes second or subsequent outright sales of intellectual propertyrights.
(^4) The relevant service item is either computer services (see paragraph 10.143), or audiovisual and related services (see paragraphs 10.162–10.166), depending
on the nature of the content provided.
For example, the sale/purchase of a copy of a software package that is mass-produced, and is obtained by an individual to load onto a single computeris covered
by a license to use that excludes reproduction and distribution; this situation would be recorded in goods or services depending on the examples (see examples
(b), (c), and (d) under software in Table 10.4). If a manufacturer pays for the right to include the software on computers that it produces, then the payment would
be a license to reproduce and/or distribute (charges for the use of intellectual property provided by the owner of the original).
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

(a) sales of customized software (however deliv-
ered) and related licenses to use;
(b) the development, production, supply, and doc-
umentation of customized software, including
operating systems, made to order for specific
users;
(c) noncustomized (mass-produced) software down-
loaded or otherwise electronically delivered,
whether with a periodic license fee or a single
payment;
(d) licenses to use noncustomized (mass-produced)
software provided on a storage device such as
a disk or CD-ROM with a periodic license fee
(noncustomized software on storage devices with
licenses that convey perpetual use is included in
goods; see paragraph 10.17(c) and Table 10.4);
(e) sales and purchases of originals and ownership
rights for software systems and applications;
(f) hardware and software consultancy and imple-
mentation services, including the management of
subcontracted computer services;
(g) hardware and software installation, including
installation of mainframes and central comput-
ing units;
(h) maintenance and repairs of computers and
peripheral equipment;
(i) data recovery services; provision of advice and
assistance on matters related to the management
of computer resources;
(j) analysis, design, and programming of systems
ready to use (including web page development
and design), and technical consultancy related
to software;
(k) systems maintenance and other support services,
such as training provided as part of consultancy;
(l) data-processing and hosting services, such as
data entry, tabulation, and processing on a time-
sharing basis;
(m) web page hosting services (i.e., the provision of
server space on the Internet to host clients’ web
pages); and
(n) provision of applications, hosting clients’ appli-
cations, and computer facilities management.
10.144 Software includes general business produc-
tivity software, computer game software, and other
applications. However, as shown in Table 10.4 and para-

graph 10.17(d), some forms of software are classified
under goods. It may be analytically useful to be able to
identify all software, whether in goods or services. The
time of recording software services follows the same
principles as for other intellectual property, identified
in paragraph 10.139.
10.145 Excluded from computer services are com-
puter training courses not designed for a specific user
(included in other personal, cultural, and recreational
services). Charges for licenses to reproduce or distrib-
ute software (or both) which are included in charges
for the use of intellectual property, are also excluded.
Leasing of computers without an operator is included in
operational leasing.
Information services
10.146 Information services include news agency
services, such as the provision of news, photographs,
and feature articles to the media. Other information
provision services include database services—database
conception, data storage, and the dissemination of data
and databases (including directories and mailing lists),
both online and through magnetic, optical, or printed
media; and web search portals (search engine services
that find Internet addresses for clients who input key-
word queries). Also included are direct nonbulk sub-
scriptions to newspapers and periodicals, whether by
mail, electronic transmission, or other means; other
online content provision services; and library and
archive services. (Bulk newspapers and periodicals are
included under general merchandise.) Downloaded con-
tent that is not software (included in computer services)
or audio and video (included in audiovisual and related
services) is included in information services.
j. Other business services
Research and development services
10.147 Research and development services consist
of services that are associated with basic research,
applied research, and experimental development of new
products and processes. In principle, such activities in
the physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities
are covered, including the development of operating
systems that represent technological advances. Also
included is commercial research related to electronics,
pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology.
10.148 The definition of research and development
services used here and in the CPC is wider than the
Frascati definition (which is used to define the scope
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
of capital formation in the 2008 SNA ); it includes other
product development that may give rise to patents.
Outright sales of the results of research and devel-
opment (such as represented in patents, copyrights,
and sale of information about industrial processes)
are included in research and development. However,
amounts payable for use of proprietary rights arising
from research and development are included under
charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e.; see
paragraphs 10.137–10.140.

Professional and management consulting services
10.149 Professional and management consulting
services include:

(a) legal services, accounting, management consult-
ing, managerial services, and public relations
services; and
(b) advertising, market research, and public opinion
polling services.
10.150 Services for the general management of a
branch, subsidiary, or associate provided by a parent
enterprise or other affiliated enterprise are included
in other business services, often under professional
and management consulting services. However, reim-
bursements of ancillary services supplied by affili-
ated enterprises, such as transport, purchasing, sales
and marketing, or computing, should be shown under
the relevant specific heading. Management fees are
included in other business services. However, dispro-
portionately large values of services between affiliated
enterprises should be examined for signs that they are
disguised dividends, such as large fluctuations that do
not reflect actual changes in the services provided.

Technical, trade-related, and other business services
10.151 Technical, trade-related, and other business
services include:

(a) architectural, engineering, and other technical
services;
(b) waste treatment and depollution, agricultural,
and mining services (discussed further in para-
graph 10.152);
(c) operating leasing services (discussed further in
paragraphs 10.153–10.157);
(d) trade-related services (discussed further in para-
graph 10.158); and
(e) other business services (discussed further in
paragraph 10.159).
Waste treatment and depollution, agricultural,
and mining services
10.152 Waste treatment and depollution services
include waste collection and disposal, remediation,
sanitation, and other environmental protection services.
They also include environmental services, such as pro-
duction of carbon offsets or carbon sequestration, that
are not classified under any more specific category.
Other technical services include agricultural, mining,
and veterinary services.
Operating leasing
10.153 Operating leasing is the activity of renting
out produced assets under arrangements that provide
use of a tangible asset to the lessee, but do not involve
the transfer of the bulk of risks and rewards of own-
ership to the lessee. Operating leasing may also be
called leasing or rental services of specified produced
assets, such as buildings or equipment, as specified in
the CPC. Rental is also used as a term for the amounts
payable under operating leases for produced assets, and
is a service.^14
10.154 Operating leasing can be identified by the
following characteristics:
(a) The lessor, or owner of the equipment, normally
maintains a stock of assets in good working
order that can be hired on demand, or at short
notice, by users;
(b) The assets may be rented out for varying periods
of time. The lessee may renew the rental when
the period expires; and
(c) The lessor is frequently responsible for the mainte-
nance and repair of the asset as part of the service
that is provided to the lessee. The lessor must nor-
mally be a specialist in the operation of the asset
and may also undertake to replace the equipment
in the event of a serious or prolonged breakdown.
Thus, in addition to the provision of an asset, the ser-
vice provided under operating leasing by the lessor
includes other elements, such as convenience and secu-
rity, servicing, and back-up facilities.
10.155 An operating lease is distinguished from:
(a) a financial lease, where the risks and rewards
of ownership of the asset are transferred to the
(^14) In contrast, rent is used to describe amounts payable under a
resource lease covering natural resources, such as land, water, or
mineral rights. Rent arising from such resource leases is included
in the primary income account, as discussed in paragraphs 11.85–
11.9 0.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

lessee; with an operating lease, the lessor has the
risks and benefits (see paragraphs 5.56–5.60 for
definition and elaboration on financial leases);
(b) a resource lease, where the asset provided is a
natural resource, rather than a produced asset
(see paragraphs 11.85–11.90 for a definition and
elaboration on resource leases and rent); and
(c) a lease included under contracts, leases, and
licenses, where the lease itself—rather than the
underlying asset—becomes an economic asset of
the lessee. (See paragraph 13.12 for elaboration
on these leases.)
10.156 Operating leasing services cover leasing
(rental) and charters, without crew, of ships, aircraft,
and transport equipment, such as railway cars, contain-
ers, and rigs, without crew. Also included are operating
lease payments relating to other types of equipment
without an operator, including computers and telecom-
munications equipment. License payments for the right
to use intangible assets, such as software, intellectual
property, and so forth are included under specific head-
ings (computer services, charges for the use of intellec-
tual property n.i.e., etc.) rather than operating leasing.
Excluded from operating leasing services are leasing
of telecommunications lines or capacity (included in
telecommunications services) and rental of ships and
aircraft with crew (included in transport services).

10.157 Operating leases of dwellings and other
buildings are included in this item, if not included in
travel. If there is no objective basis on which to split
the payment between rent on land and rental on the
buildings, it is recommended to treat the whole amount
as rental when the building component is believed to
exceed the land component, and as a rent otherwise.
However, rent of land alone and rent of other natural
resources are classified as primary income (such leases
are called resource leases; see paragraph 11.85). Rental
of buildings by international organizations, embassies,
and so forth, is included under government goods and
services n.i.e. Rental of accommodation and vehicles
to nonresidents during visits to other economies is
included in travel (see paragraphs 10.86–10.88).

Tr a de- rel a ted ser vi ces
10.158 Trade-related services cover commissions on
goods and service transactions payable to merchants,
commodity brokers, dealers, auctioneers, and commis-
sion agents. For example, these services include the auc-
tioneer’s fee or agent’s commission on sales of ships,
aircraft, and other goods. If the trader owns the goods

being sold, the trader’s margin is generally included indis-
tinguishably in general merchandise FOB (if the goods
pass through the economy of the trader) or under goods
under merchanting (otherwise). However, any margins
not included in the FOB price of the goods are included
in trade-related services. Brokerage on financial instru-
ments is excluded from trade-related services (included in
financial services) as are transport-related charges, such
as agency commissions (included in transport services).
Other business services
10.159 Other business services include distribution
services related to water, steam, gas, and other petro-
leum products and air-conditioning supply, where these
are identified separately from transmission services;
placement of personnel, security, and investigative ser-
vices; translation and interpretation; photographic ser-
vices; publishing; building cleaning; and real estate
services. Also included are forfeited down payments
not able to be specified to any other service.
10.160 Business and other services, such as trans-
port, construction, and computing, may be sub-
contracted. This arrangement may also be called
“outsourcing.” For example, a specialist service
arranger may be paid to provide back-office functions
for a customer, which the service arranger subcontracts
to another contractor. Thus, subcontracting is similar
in some ways to merchanting of goods, because the
services are purchased and resold. However, for ser-
vices, the degree of transformation involved may be
harder to assess than for goods, such as in the case
of bundling and managing the services of different
contractors. “Service merchanting” of this kind is an
important activity in some economies. The value of
services exported and imported in the economy of the
service arranger is recorded on a gross basis. (This
treatment is applicable because the arranger buys and
sells the services; if the arranger acted as an agent on
a commission basis, then only the commission would
be recorded as the service provided by the arranger.)
These services are classified to the appropriate spe-
cific service classification, such as transport, con-
struction, computing, or other business services. (See
also paragraph 10.75 for transport.) However, if the
activity is significant for an economy, net data could
be provided on a supplementary basis.
k. Personal, cultural, and recreational services
10.161 Personal, cultural, and recreational services
consist of (a) audiovisual and related services and (b)
other personal, cultural, and recreational services.
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
Audiovisual and related services
10.162 Audiovisual and related services consist of
services and fees related to the production of motion
pictures (on film, videotape, disk, or transmitted elec-
tronically, etc.), radio and television programs (live or
on tape), and musical recordings. Table 10.4 summa-
rizes the treatment of intellectual property associated
with audiovisual and related services, as well as other
types of intellectual property.

10.163 Included are amounts receivable or payable for
rentals of audiovisual and related products, and charges
for access to encrypted television channels (such as cable
and satellite services). Fees to actors, directors, and pro-
ducers involved with theatrical and musical productions,
sporting events, circuses, and other similar events are
included in this item (unless they are employees of the
entity making payments, in which case the transactions
are classified as compensation of employees).

10.164 Mass-produced recordings and manuscripts
that are purchased or sold outright or for perpetual
use are included under audiovisual and related services
if downloaded (i.e., delivered electronically). How-
ever, those on CD-ROM, disk, paper, and so forth,
are included in general merchandise. Similar products
obtained through a license to use (other than when
conveying perpetual use) are included in audiovisual
and related services, as is the use of other online con-
tent related to audio and visual media. (See paragraph
10.166 for the treatment of originals.) The principles for
the timing for related audiovisual and related services,
such as for music and film copyrights and for master
recordings, are the same as those for other types of
intellectual property, as discussed in paragraph 10.139.

10.165 Charges or licenses to reproduce or dis-
tribute (or both) radio, television, film, music, and
so forth are excluded from audiovisual and related
services and included in charges for the use of intel-
lectual property n.i.e.

10.166 Purchases and sales of original manuscripts,
sound recordings, films, and so forth are included in
audiovisual and related services.

Other personal, cultural, and recreational services
10.167 Other personal, cultural, and recreational
services include health services, education services,
and others, as discussed in the following paragraphs.

10.168 Health services consist of services provided
by hospitals, doctors, nurses, and paramedical and simi-
lar personnel, as well as laboratory and similar services,

whether rendered remotely or on-site. However, health
services provided to nonresidents who are present in the
territory of the service provider are included in travel (see
also paragraph 10.94). Veterinary services are included
in other technical services (see paragraph 10.152).
10.169 Education services consist of services relating to
education, such as correspondence courses and education
via television or the Internet, as well as by teachers and
so forth who supply services directly in host economies.
However, education services provided to nonresidents
who are present in the territory of the service provider are
included in travel (see also paragraph 10.94).
10.170 Other personal, cultural, and recreational
services include those associated with museums and
other cultural, sporting, gambling, and recreational
activities, except those included in travel. The fees and
prizes of athletes are included.
10.171 The amounts paid for lottery tickets or placed
in bets consist of two elements:
(a) a service charge receivable by the unit organiz-
ing the lottery or gambling (this charge may also
have to cover taxes on gambling); and
(b) transfers to cover the amounts payable to the
winners and, in some cases, amounts payable to
charities.
The value of the lottery and other gambling services
supplied by or to nonresidents is estimated as the amount
wagered by nonresidents multiplied by the overall ratio
of services to the total amount wagered for that gambling
operator or type of gambling. This method for sepa-
rately identifying the service component is similar to the
method used for insurance services. For current transfers
associated with gambling, see paragraphs 12.25–12.26.
10.172 Acquisition of other personal, cultural, and
recreational services (such as education, health, muse-
ums, and gambling) by persons while outside their ter-
ritory of residence is included in travel (see paragraph
10.88) and excluded from this item.
l. Government goods and services n.i.e.
10.173 Government goods and services n.i.e. cover:
(a) goods and services supplied by and to enclaves,
such as embassies, military bases, and interna-
tional organizations;
(b) goods and services acquired from the host economy
by diplomats, consular staff, and military person-
nel located abroad and their dependents; and
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

(c) services supplied by and to governments and not
included in other categories of services.
Transactions of public corporations (defined in para-
graph 4.108) are not included, unless the other party is
one of the specified types of institutions.

Goods and services supplied by and to government
and international organization enclaves
10.174 As government and international organiza-
tion enclaves are not residents of the territory in which
they are physically located (as discussed further in
paragraph 4.5(e)), their transactions with residents of
the territory of location are international transactions.
For the same reason, transactions of embassies, mili-
tary bases, and so forth with their home economies are
resident-to-resident and outside the scope of interna-
tional accounts.

10.175 Government goods and services n.i.e. credits
include the supply of goods and services to embassies,
consulates, military units or bases, defense agencies, and
other official entities (such as aid missions; government
tourism, information, and trade promotion offices) of
foreign governments located in the compiling economy.

10.176 Government goods and services n.i.e. debits
include acquisition of goods and services by embassies,
and so forth of the government of the compiling econ-
omy in other territories. Charges for visas and other
services provided by embassies and consulates are also
included in government goods and services n.i.e. The
supply and purchase of goods and services by interna-
tional organizations are also included in government
goods and services n.i.e. The acquisition of goods and
services for joint military arrangements, peacekeeping
forces, and other services, such as those provided by the
United Nations, are also included in government goods
and services n.i.e.

10.177 All types of goods and services, such as
office supplies, vehicles, repairs, electricity, and rental
of premises, for embassies, military bases, international
organizations, and so forth purchased from the host
economy or economies other than the home economy
are included under government goods and services n.i.e.
However, construction of new and existing structures is
included under construction (see paragraph 10.108).

Goods and services acquired by staff employed in
enclaves and their dependents
10.178 All expenditure on goods and services by dip-
lomats, consular staff, and military personnel located

abroad in the economies in which they are located is also
included in government goods and services n.i.e. (These
staff are classed as nonresidents of the territory of their
location, as discussed in paragraph 4.123.) The expendi-
ture of dependent members of the same household is also
included. However, the expenditure of locally engaged
staff of embassies, military bases, and so forth and inter-
national organization staff is not included in government
goods and services n.i.e. (and is usually a resident-to-resi-
dent transaction). (These staff are classed as residents of
the territory of their location, as discussed in paragraphs
4.123–4.124.) The supply of goods and services to foreign
diplomats and so forth located in the compiling economy
is shown as credits, while the expenditure of the compil-
ing economy’s diplomats and so forth in the economy of
their posting is shown as debits. (Goods disposed of by
diplomats, and so forth are similarly recorded with the
signs reversed; for example, a car sold at the end of a post-
ing is shown as a debit to the local economy.)
Otherservicessuppliedbyandtogovernments
10.179 Services supplied by and to governments
should be classified to specific services (business ser-
vices, health, etc.), if possible. For instance, acquisition
of new and existing buildings for an embassy, consul-
ate, and so forth is classified as construction, rather
than government goods and services n.i.e. (see para-
graph 10.108). However, some services are related to
government functions that are not able to be classified
to another specific service category, so are classified
as government services n.i.e. For example, techni-
cal assistance on public administration is included in
government services. Also, payments for police-type
services (such as keeping order), such as those sup-
plied with mutual agreement by a foreign government
or international organization, are included in govern-
ment services n.i.e. Additionally, government supply of
licenses and permits that are classified as services (as
discussed in paragraphs 10.180-10.181) are also govern-
ment services n.i.e. Box 10.6 covers issues associated
with technical assistance.
Government licenses, permits, and so forth
10.180 One of the regulatory functions of govern-
ments is to forbid the ownership or use of certain goods
or the pursuit of certain activities, unless specific per-
mission is granted by issuing a license or other cer-
tificate for a fee. If the issue of such licenses involves
little or no work on the part of government, the licenses
being granted automatically on payment, it is likely that
they are simply a device to raise taxes, even though the
Chapter 10 g Goods and Services Account
government may provide some kind of certificate, or
authorization, in return. However, if the government
uses the issue of licenses to exercise some proper regu-
latory function, such as checking the competence or
qualifications of the person concerned, checking the
efficient and safe functioning of equipment, or carry-
ing out some other form of control that it would other-
wise not be obliged to do, the payments made should
be treated as purchases of services from government
rather than payments of taxes, unless the payments are
clearly out of all proportion to the costs of providing
the services.

10.181 The borderline between taxes and payments
of charges for services rendered is not always clear-

cut in practice.^15 By convention, amounts payable by
households for licenses to own or use vehicles, boats,
or aircraft and also licenses for recreational hunt-
ing, shooting, or fishing are treated as taxes, whereas
amounts payable by households for all other kinds of
licenses, permits, certificates, passports, and so forth,
are treated as purchases of services. (For more details
on taxes, see paragraph 12.30.)
(^15) In the case of permits issued by the private sector, treatment as
a tax is not an option, so the fee can only be a service or contract,
lease, or license asset. In the case of licenses (government or pri-
vate) that may be resold by the holder, the resale is recorded in the
capital account under contracts, leases, and licenses (see paragraphs
13.11–13.16).
Who provides technical assistance?
Technical assistance is provided by the entity that
employs the personnel delivering the services (technical
assistance personnel), which could include a non-govern-
ment entity. The provider is not necessarily the same as
the party that provides the funding.
What is the residence of the technical assistance
provider?
Technical assistance provided by an entity resident in
the donor economy should be recorded as an export of a
service by the donor economy to the recipient economy.
How is technical assistance classified?
Technical assistance covers a wide variety of different
services, including computing and business services, and
should be classified by the nature of the service provided
to specific services, if possible. Technical assistance pro-
vided by government, or an international organization, is
classified as government services only when not classified
to a specific service, and where the technical assistance
personnel are employed by the donor government or an
international organization.
How is technical assistance funded?
Technical assistance may be subject to payment by the
recipient, or funded by a current or capital transfer from
the donor.
When cross-border technical assistance is provided
without a fee being charged to the recipient, a current
or capital transfer for the value of the services provided
is recorded. If a third party funds the costs of technical
assistance, then the funds provided are routed through the
recipient economy to the service (or technical assistance)
providing economy.
In principle the value of the services provided is estimated
by the costs incurred by the donor government (including
any costs in the donor economy, recipient economy, or a third
economy) in providing technical assistance. In the absence
of detailed information the value could be estimated by the
salary paid to the technical assistance personnel plus any
other identifiable costs (such as travel costs).
How are payments to technical assistance person-
nel classified?
If the technical assistance personnel are resident in the
donor economy and employed by the donor government,
payments to these technical assistance personnel are only
recorded in the domestic accounts of the donor economy.
If the technical assistance personnel are resident in the
recipient economy (or any economy other than the donor
economy) but employed by the donor government, com-
pensation of employees payable by the donor economy is
recorded in the international accounts (paragraph 11.15).
If the technical assistance personnel are resident in the
recipient economy, considered employed by the recipient
government, but their salaries are paid by the donor gov-
ernment, a current transfer from the donor to the recipient
economy (paragraph 12.47) is recorded in the interna-
tional accounts, with the recipient government imputed as
paying compensation to the resident technical assistance
personnel in the domestic accounts of the recipient econ-
omy. In this case, the output of the technical assistance is
attributed to the recipient economy.
If the technical assistance personnel are resident in
the recipient economy but are not considered to be in
an employer-employee relationship with the donor or the
recipient entity (see paragraphs 11.11–11.12) then pay-
ments to them are classified as payments for services, not
the compensation of employees.
If the technical assistance activities in the recipient
economy are such that a branch is recognized (paragraphs
4.26–4.28) and the technical assistance personnel are
employed by the branch, payment of compensation by the
donor economy is rerouted through the branch as equity.

Chapter 11. Primary Income Account
A. Overview of the Primary Income Account
Reference:

2008 SNA, Chapter 7, The Distribution of Income
Accounts.
11.1 The primary income account shows primary
income flows between resident and nonresident institu-
tional units. In the SNA , primary distribution of income
is recorded in two accounts, namely, the generation of
income account (which records primary income gen-
erated in the production process) and the allocation
of primary income account (which records primary
income allocated to institutional units for the provision
of labor, financial assets, and natural resources). In the
international accounts, all primary income flows relate
to the allocation of primary income account.

11.2 The main components and structure of the
account are shown in Table 11.1. Credit entries reflect
primary income receivable by the compiling economy
and debit entries reflect primary income payable by the
compiling economy. The balance on primary income
shows net primary income receivable by the compiling
economy, which is defined as the total value of primary
income receivable by the compiling economy less the
total value of primary income payable.

11.3 Primary income represents the return that
accrues to institutional units for their contribution to the
production process or for the provision of financial assets
and renting natural resources to other institutional units.
Two types of primary income are distinguished:

(a) Income associated with the production process.
Compensation of employees is income for the
contribution of labor inputs to the production
process. Taxes and subsidies on products and
production are also income related to produc-
tion; and
(b) Income associated with the ownership of financial
and other nonproduced assets. Property income is
the return for providing financial assets and rent-
ing natural resources. Investment income is the
return for providing financial assets; it consists of
dividends and withdrawals from income of quasi-
corporations, reinvested earnings, and interest.
However, ownership of financial derivatives and
employee stock options does not give rise to invest-
ment income. The relationship between financial
assets and the type of investment income they
generate is shown in Table 5.2.
11.4 Cross-border primary income flows provide
a link between the concept of gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) and gross national income (GNI). GDP is
linked to the concept of production, in which value
added is generated. Contributors to the value added
(such as labor, finance, and entrepreneurship) receive
returns for their contributions. The economic process
of income generation from production together with
primary income distributions result in the GNI for an
economy. The difference between the GNI and GDP
is equal to the difference of primary income receiv-
able from nonresidents and primary income payable
to nonresidents, often described as “net income from
abroad.” When labor, financial resources, and natu-
ral resources owned by residents are put at the use of
nonresidents, primary income is earned. When labor,
financial resources, and natural resources are owned by
nonresidents and are put at the use of residents, primary
income is payable. GNI is larger (smaller) than GDP if
more (less) income is generated from the provision of
labor, financial resources, and natural resources owned
by residents to nonresidents than the similar income
payable to nonresidents.
11.5 Primary income should be distinguished
from secondary income. Primary income captures
returns for the provision of labor and financial assets
and renting of natural resources. Secondary income
captures further redistribution of income through
current transfers, such as by governments or chari-
table organizations. Secondary income is described
in Chapter 12.

11.6 The structure of the primary income account
is consistent with that of the corresponding financial
flows and positions, thus facilitating the analysis of
rates of return. (See Table 5.2 for classification of
financial assets and liabilities and the corresponding
type of income they generate.) For example, rent is
shown separately so that it is not mixed with returns
on financial assets. Investment income attributable to
policyholders in insurance, standardized guarantees,
and pension funds is also to be shown as a separate
item, if relevant. Specific further groupings of primary
income are discussed in the subsequent sections.

11.7 Section B of this chapter discusses the cov-
erage, timing, and valuation issues for each type of
primary income (compensation of employees, divi-

dends, reinvested earnings, interest, investment income
attributable to policyholders in insurance, standardized
guarantees, and pension funds, rent, and taxes and sub-
sidies on products and production). Section C explains
specific issues and possible classification of invest-
ment income by functional category of financial assets
and liabilities (direct investment, portfolio investment,
other investment, and reserve assets).
B. Types of Primary Income
11.8 The international accounts distinguish the fol-
lowing types of primary income:
(a) compensation of employees;
(b) dividends;
(c) reinvested earnings;
(d) interest;

11.9 Table 11.1 presents investment income using
both functional and instrument classifications of finan-
cial assets. Investment income is generally linked to a
particular type of financial instrument. For example,
dividends are returns on equity and investment fund
shares. Sometimes, a group of financial instruments
has the same type of investment income. For example,
deposits, loans, and debt securities all give rise to inter-
est. This section describes various types of investment
income and other types of primary income. The next
section includes a description of specific issues on
investment income related to the functional categories
of financial assets and liabilities.

1. Compensation of employees

11.10 Compensation of employees presents remu-
neration in return for the labor input to the production
process contributed by an individual in an employer-
employee relationship with the enterprise. In the
international accounts, compensation of employees is
recorded when the employer (the producing unit) and
the employee are resident in different economies. For
the economy where the producing units are resident,
compensation of employees is the total remuneration, in
cash or in kind, payable by resident enterprises to non-
resident employees in return for work done by the latter
during the accounting period. For the economy where
the individuals are resident, it is the total remuneration,
in cash or in kind, receivable by them from nonresident
enterprises in return for work done during the account-
ing period. Residence of enterprises and individuals is
described in Section E of Chapter 4, Economic Terri-
tory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and Residence.

11.11 Cross-border compensation of employees
arises only when a resident individual is employed by
a nonresident or when a resident employs a nonresident
individual. Therefore, it is important to establish whether
an employer-employee relationship exists between a res-
ident individual and a nonresident employer or between
a nonresident individual and a resident employer. An
employer-employee relationship exists when there is an
agreement, which may be formal or informal, between

an entity and an individual, normally entered into vol-
untarily by both parties, whereby the individual works
for the entity in return for remuneration in cash or in
kind. The remuneration is normally based on either the
time spent at work or some other objective indicator
of the amount of work undertaken. If an individual is
contracted to produce a given result, it suggests a ser-
vice contract relationship between the entity and a self-
employed. Self-employed individuals are deemed to
operate their own unincorporated enterprises, and thus
sell output they produce. Self-employed individuals
may also employ others. Self-employed individuals are
generally responsible for decisions on markets, scale of
operations, and finance, and are also likely to own or
rent machinery or equipment on which they work.
11.12 When an individual performs work for an entity,
it may not always be clear whether an employer-employee
relationship exists between the individual and the entity.
Provision of several types of services may pose such prob-
lems because entities may choose either to purchase a ser-
vice from a self-employed worker or to hire an employee
to perform the job. The status of the worker has important
implications for the international accounts. If an employer-
employee relationship exists between the worker and the
producing entity, the payment constitutes compensation
of employees. If an employer-employee relationship does
not exist, the payment constitutes a purchase of services.
(See Chapter 10, Goods and Services Account for specific
categories of services.)
11.13 Several factors may have to be considered in
determining whether an employer-employee relation-
ship exists. An important test of whether an employer-
employee relationship exists is that of control. The right
to control or to direct, both as to what shall be done
and how it shall be done, is a strong indication of an
employer-employee relationship. The method of mea-
suring or arranging for the payment is not important as
long as the employer has the effective control on both
the method and the result of the work undertaken by the
individual. However, certain control on the work being
undertaken may also exist for the purchase of a service.
Therefore, other criteria should also be used to define
more clearly the employer-employee relationship. If the
individual is solely responsible for social contributions,
that would suggest that the individual is a self-employed
service provider. Payment of social contributions by the
employer is an indication of employer-employee rela-
tionship. If the individual is entitled to the same kind
of benefits (e.g., allowances, holidays, sick leave) that
the enterprise generally provides to its employees, this
indicates an employer-employee relationship. Payment
Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account
of taxes on the provision of services (such as sales tax
or value-added tax) by the individual is an indication
that the individual is a self-employed service provider.

11.14 Cross-border employees include seasonal or
other short-term workers (less than one year) and bor-
der workers who are residents of one economy and work
in another economy. Nonresidents who are employed as
domestic helpers or housekeepers (for less than one
year) by resident households are also treated as nonresi-
dent employees. Because embassies, consulates, mili-
tary bases, and so forth are considered extraterritorial
to the economies in which they are located (see Chapter
4, Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and
Residence; Section E, Residence, for the definition of
residence), the compensation receivable by local (host
country) staff of these institutional entities is classified
as payable to resident entities by nonresident entities.
Compensation receivable by employees from interna-
tional organizations, which are extraterritorial entities,
represents receipts from nonresident entities.

11.15 According to the residence principles for house-
holds as explained in paragraphs 4.116–4.130, technical
assistance personnel employed by international organiza-
tions or governments on long-term assignments (for one
year or more) are residents of the economy in which they
reside (unless they are government employees with diplo-
matic status). Similarly, employees of parent enterprises
working in an affiliated enterprise in another economy
for one year or more are residents of the economy in
which they reside. Although such employees continue
to be legally employed and paid by the parent enterprise
(which may be international organizations, foreign gov-
ernments, or commercial enterprises), their employer-
employee relationship may not always be clear. They
should be considered employees of the institutional unit
for which they work if this unit effectively manages and
controls their work. The contractual arrangement for
hiring or paying salaries may simply be a matter of con-
venience. In some cases it may be difficult to determine
who is managing and controlling the work. In such cases,
the workers should be considered to be employed by the
entity that pays them.

11.16 Compensation of employees is recorded on an
accrual basis. It is measured by the value of the remu-
neration in cash or in kind that an employee becomes
entitled to receive from an employer with respect to
work undertaken during the relevant period, whether
paid in advance, simultaneously, or in arrears of the
work itself. To the extent that payment has not been
made for work performed, the economy of the employer
must record an entry in the accounts payable and the

economy of the employee must record an entry in the
accounts receivable.
11.17 Compensation of employees has three main
components:
(a) wages and salaries in cash,
(b) wages and salaries in kind, and
(c) employers’ social contributions.
a. Wages and salaries in cash
11.18 Wages and salaries in cash consist of amounts
payable in cash (or any other financial instruments used
as means of payments) to employees in return for labor
input rendered, before deducting withholding taxes and
employees’ contributions to social insurance schemes
(which are shown in the secondary income account;
see paragraph 12.35). Included are basic wages and
salaries; extra pay for overtime, night work, and week-
end work; cost of living allowances, local allowances,
and expatriation allowances; bonuses; annual supple-
mentary pay, such as “thirteenth month” pay; allow-
ances for transportation to and from work; holiday pay
for official holidays or annual holidays; and housing
allowances. Wages and salaries in cash do not include
the reimbursement by employers of expenditures made
by employees in order to enable them to take up new
or relocated jobs (e.g., reimbursement for travel and
related expenses) or expenditures on items needed to
carry out their work (e.g., tools or special clothing).
These are shown as acquisition by the employer of
goods and services.
b. Wages and salaries in kind
11.19 Wages and salaries in kind consist of amounts
payable in the form of goods, services, interest forgone,
and shares to employees in return for labor input ren-
dered. Examples are meals; accommodation; sports,
recreation, or holiday facilities for employees and their
families; transportation to and from work; goods and
services from the employer’s own processes of produc-
tion; bonus shares distributed to employees; and so
forth. Benefits in kind should be valued at the market-
equivalent price. The goods or services may be provided
free or at a reduced cost. For example, when employees
receive loans at reduced or zero rates of interest, the
interest forgone is the difference between the interest
charged and a market-equivalent interest charge. To
provide a consistent and economically meaningful way
of recording benefits in kind, some “rerouting” may be
involved (see paragraph 3.16 for an example of rerout-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

ing). That is, although the benefits are purchased by
the employer, the benefits are treated as if the employer
paid the amount of the benefit to the employee who, in
turn, acquired the item. The rerouting may affect the
resident-to-nonresident nature of the transaction.

11.20 Employee stock options (ESOs) are a way of
paying wages and salaries in kind. ESOs are valued
by reference to the fair value of the equity underly-
ing the ESO awarded. The value of ESOs at the time
of granting provides the measure of compensation of
employees that should be recorded as accruing over the
period to which the option relates, generally the period
between the granting and vesting dates. Sometimes, the
options may cover the period before the granting date,
which should also be taken into account in allocating
the compensation of employees. The value of the ESO
accumulates as compensation of employees is recorded,
so that at vesting date, it has accumulated to the value
of the ESO at granting. Changes in the value of ESOs
at or after the vesting date are not compensation of
employees, but are holding gains and losses (see para-
graph 9.30). Transactions and positions in ESOs are
recorded within financial derivatives and ESOs, with
a supplementary item for economies in which cross-
border transactions in ESOs are significant.

11.21 In cross-border situations, a multinational par-
ent company may directly provide ESOs to employees
of its foreign subsidiaries. The value of ESOs should
be recorded as compensation of employees payable
by the subsidiary, the actual employer, and hence this
transaction is domestic. The liabilities of the parent
companies and acquisition of assets by the employees
of the subsidiary in the form of ESOs are recorded in
the respective economies’ international accounts. If the
ESO is supplied free or below cost to the subsidiary,
a transaction between the parent and actual employer
should be imputed for the value of the ESO similar
to the treatment of transfer pricing (see paragraphs
11.101–11.102).

c. Employers’ social contributions

11.22 Employers’ social contributions are social
contributions payable by employers to social security
funds or other employment-related social insurance
schemes to secure social benefits for their employ-
ees. Social security schemes are operated by general
government; other employer-related social insurance
schemes may be operated by the employers themselves
or by an insurance corporation or may be an auton-
omous pension scheme. Examples of social benefits

include employers’ contributions or subsidies for pen-
sions, life insurance, and health insurance; allowances
for children, spouse, family, education, or other pay-
ments with respect to dependents; payments made to
workers absent from work because of illness, accidental
injury, maternity leave, and so forth; and severance pay-
ments. Both actual and imputed social contributions are
included. For defined contribution employer pension
schemes, the actual amounts payable by employers are
included in the compensation of employees. For defined
benefit pension schemes, including unfunded pension
schemes, the amount of employers’ social contributions
should be determined on the basis of actuarial calcula-
tions that yield contributions required to secure the de
facto entitlements to the social benefits. (See paragraph
5.66 for the definition of pension entitlements.)
11.23 Employees who are employed outside their
economy of residence may incur travel expenses (see
paragraphs 10.91–10.93) and may be subject to the pay-
ment of income taxes (see paragraph 12.28). These flows
should be recorded on a gross basis respectively as travel
expenses and taxes on income; that is, they should not be
deducted from compensation of employees.
2. Dividends and withdrawals from income of
quasi-corporations
11.24 Dividends are the distributed earnings allo-
cated to the owners of equity for placing funds at the
disposal of corporations. Raising equity through the
issue of shares is an alternative way of raising funds
compared to borrowing. In contrast to debt financing,
however, equity finance does not give rise to a liability
that is fixed in monetary terms and does not entitle the
holders of shares of a corporation to a fixed or predeter-
mined income. Owners of equity receive their share of
distributed earnings, the timing and amounts of which
are decided by corporations.
11.25 The concept of dividends is linked to the
instrument classification; namely, they are the return
payable by corporations to their shareholders or own-
ers.^1 Dividends are most often quoted in terms of the
amount of money declared payable per share. They may
also be quoted in terms of a percentage of the market
value of shares, referred to as dividend yield. Income on
nonparticipating preference shares is treated as inter-
est income, rather than dividend income, because such
shares are classified as debt instruments.

(^1) Manufactured dividends are discussed in paragraph 11.69.
Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account

11.26 In addition to dividends from corporations,
distributed income from quasi-corporations (such as
distributed branch profits) should be included under
this heading. In legal terms, quasi-corporations can-
not distribute income in the form of dividends. Nev-
ertheless, the owner, or owners, of a quasi-corporation
may choose to withdraw some or all of the income of
the enterprise, and some quasi-corporations formally
organized as trusts, partnerships, or other institutions
may formally distribute some or only a portion of their
earnings. From an economic point of view, the with-
drawal of such income is equivalent to the distribution
of corporate income through dividends and is treated
the same way. Withdrawals from income of quasi-cor-
porations do not include withdrawals of funds realized
by the sale or disposal of the quasi-corporation’s assets
(e.g., the sale of inventories, fixed assets, or land or
other natural resources). Transmittal of funds resulting
from such disposals of assets is recorded as a with-
drawal from the equity of quasi-corporations in the
financial account. Income from rent earned on land
and buildings directly held by nonresidents is also clas-
sified under dividends and distributed incomes from a
notional direct investment enterprise.

11.27 Exceptional payments by corporations
(including quasi-corporations such as branches) to their
shareholders that are made out of accumulated reserves
or sales of assets should not be treated as dividends.
Such exceptional payments, sometimes called super-
dividends, are treated as withdrawals of equity, and
therefore recorded in the financial account (as noted
in paragraph 8.23). The exceptional nature of the pay-
ments is normally determined as being disproportion-
ately large relative to the recent level of dividends and
earnings. Although dividends are notionally paid out
of the current period’s operating surplus, corporations
often smooth the payments of dividends, sometimes
paying out rather less than operating surplus but other
times paying out a little more, especially when the oper-
ating surplus itself is very low. For practical reasons, no
attempt is made to align dividend payments with earn-
ings except when the dividends are disproportionately
large. If the level of dividends declared is greatly in
excess of previous dividends and trends in earnings, the
excess should be excluded from dividends and shown as
a withdrawal of equity (see paragraph 8.23).

11.28 Stock dividends arise where stockholders elect
to receive payments of dividends in the form of issue of
new shares. The stock dividends are essentially a capi-
talization of earnings and an alternative to distributing
cash dividends. Therefore, stock dividends are treated

as income (in the primary income account), which is
then immediately reinvested (in the financial account).
11.29 Bonus shares refer to issues of new shares
to all stockholders in proportion to existing owner-
ship. These arrangements are not treated as transac-
tions because no new resources have been provided.
The claim of the shareholders on the entity is the same
before and after the issuance of bonus shares. (See also
paragraph 8.33.)
11.30 Liquidating dividends, whether partial or
total, arise mainly at the time of the termination of a
company. These are treated as a withdrawal of equity,
shown in the financial account, as a convention based
on the assumption that liquidating dividends are more
likely to involve previously existing equity finance
rather than current income.
11.31 Dividends are recorded at the time the
shares go ex-dividend (see paragraph 3.48 for record-
ing of dividends). Withdrawals of income from quasi-
corporations, that is, distributed profits, are recorded
when they are withdrawn by their owners. Dividends
and withdrawals from income of quasi-corporations
are recorded gross of any withholding taxes. These
taxes are deemed to be payable by recipients of such
income.
11.32 Dividends and withdrawals by owners of
quasi-corporations are also identified for equity in
investment funds. Investment funds are usually portfo-
lio investment, but they may also occur in other func-
tional categories. For equity in investment funds and
direct investment, the owners’ earnings include both
the distributed income and reinvested earnings.
3. Reinvested earnings
11.33 This section describes the treatment in the
international accounts of reinvested earnings from
equity participation. Reinvested earnings is associated
with the concept of attributing retained earnings to
their owners.
11.34 Retained earnings of an enterprise shows the
net earnings from production and primary and second-
ary income transactions before attributing reinvested
earnings. It is equal to net operating surplus plus pri-
mary income, current transfers receivable, and change
in pension entitlements, and minus primary income
(excluding reinvested earnings payable to the enter-
prise’s direct investors and owners of investment funds)
and current transfers payable. Retained earnings of
investment funds and the part of the retained earnings

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

of direct investment enterprises that belongs to direct
investors are treated as being distributed to the owners
who then are deemed to reinvest back. The imputation
of income to the owners of investment funds and direct
investors is shown in the primary income account as
“reinvested earnings” and the corresponding flow is
recorded in the financial account as “reinvestment of
earnings” (see paragraphs 8.15–8.16 for the recording
of financial account entries). Reinvestment of earnings
is an imputed financial transaction. In the position data,
reinvestment of earnings is not shown separately but
included implicitly in the total value of equity.

11.35 In macroeconomic statistics, corporations
are defined as entities separate from their owners
and able to take economic decisions (see paragraphs
4.13–4.15 for the definition of corporations as institu-
tional units). Owners receive dividends and face other
financial gains and losses arising from the activity
of the corporations they own.^2 For corporations, the
notion that the institutional units are decision-making
entities implies that retained earnings are treated as
the income and saving of that entity rather than those
of its owners. So the undistributed income arising
from the net operating surplus, net property income,
and net current transfers is recorded as retained earn-
ings or net saving of corporations. Losses are negative
net saving. Quasi-corporations, such as branches and
notional units, are treated in the same way as incor-
porated entities.

11.36 However, when retaining earnings is a deliber-
ate decision of owners to reinvest, treating them as if
they were retained by corporations would not reflect
economic reality. Although most economic relationships
between a corporation and its owners may be considered
to take place in an arm’s length situation, the distribu-
tion of its net earnings to its owners, in some cases,
may be subject to the control and influence the owners
have on corporate decisions. Attribution of cross-border
income is particularly important for deriving consistent
and comparable measures of national disposable income
and national saving. Retained earnings of investment
funds and the part of the retained earnings of direct
investment enterprises belonging to direct investors are
treated as being distributed to the owners and reinvested
back by the owners in their enterprises.

(^2) The amount of dividends payable in any given accounting period
depends on a range of factors, including the corporation’s judgment
of its own investment opportunities relative to those available in the
market, differences in the tax treatment of distributed and undistrib-
uted income, and the degree of influence and control of the owners
in management decisions.
a. Investment income attributable to investment
fund shareholders
11.37 Investment income attributable to the owners
of investment fund shares (or units) includes dividends
payable to them as well as reta ined ea r n ings. I nvestment
funds provide a convenient, accessible, and affordable
vehicle for financial investment. Typically, investment
funds sell shares or units to the public and invest in a
diversified portfolio of securities, although they may
also invest in other assets, including real estate, or they
may be limited to a small number of investors (see
paragraphs 4.73–4.75 on investment funds as an institu-
tional subsector). Each share represents a proportional
equity in the investment portfolio managed by invest-
ment funds.
11.38 Earnings from investment funds can be
viewed as being passed on to their shareholders (or uni-
tholders) as they are earned in the form of investment
income on their equity. Investment funds earn income
by investing the money received from shareholders.
Shareholders’ income from investment funds is defined
as the investment income earned on the fund’s invest-
ment portfolio after deducting operating expenses. The
net earnings of investment funds after deducting the
operating expenses belong to shareholders. When only
a part of the net earnings is distributed to shareholders
as dividends, the retained earnings should be treated
as if they were distributed to the shareholders and then
deemed reinvested. The consequence of the treatment
of the retained earnings of investment funds is that the
saving of investment funds is always zero.
11.39 Investment income attributable to owners of
investment funds excludes holding gains and losses
arising from investment by the funds. Holding gains
and losses are recorded in the other changes in finan-
cial assets and liabilities account. (If dividends from
an investment fund include distribution of amounts
derived from holding gains, reinvested earnings may
be negative.)
b. Reinvested earnings on direct investment
11.40 Investment income attributable to direct
investors on their equity includes dividends, withdraw-
als from income of quasi-corporations, and reinvested
earnings. The reinvested earnings are the direct inves-
tors’ share of the retained earnings of the direct invest-
ment enterprise. Reinvested earnings are attributed to
direct investors who are in an immediate direct invest-
ment relationship with the direct investment enterprises
(i.e., when equity participation by direct investors meets
Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account

the 10 percent threshold). However, reinvested earnings
are not attributed to direct investors when the equity
participation provides less than 10 percent of the vot-
ing power. (For example, a direct investor may directly
hold a stake of 1 percent of an indirectly held subsid-
iary; although it is a direct investor by virtue of the
chain of ownership, it is not shown as a direct recipi-
ent of reinvested earnings on its 1 percent holding.)
Paragraphs 6.8–6.24 define direct investment relation-
ships. In the case of a government-owned nonresident
entity used solely for fiscal purposes, transactions are
imputed between the government and the government-
owned nonresident entity to reflect the fiscal activities
of the government (see paragraphs 8.24–8.26). There-
fore, such government-owned entities do not give rise to
reinvested earnings.

11.41 The rationale behind the treatment of rein-
vested earnings on direct investment is that, because
a direct investment enterprise is, by definition, subject
to control, or influence, by a direct investor or inves-
tors, the decision to retain and reinvest some of its
earnings within the enterprise represents an invest-
ment decision on the part of the direct investor(s).
Many factors may influence the decisions of direct
investors on the proportions of net earnings of direct
investment enterprises to be distributed or retained,
including taxation systems, transfer costs, investment
opportunities in the ongoing business and elsewhere,
relative costs of moving financial resources, and need
to expand the ongoing business. Therefore, attributing
the retained earnings of direct investment enterprises
to their direct investors is needed for consistent and
comparable measures of national income and national
saving. However, because reinvested earnings are
recorded only for equity in direct investment and
investment funds, but not for other types of equity,
it may be useful for some analysis to have measures
of income and the current account with and without
reinvested earnings.

11.42 Reinvested earnings represent the direct inves-
tors’ proportion, in terms of equity held, of the earnings
that foreign subsidiaries and associates do not distribute
as dividends. The undistributed earnings of branches
are also considered to be reinvested earnings.

11.43 Reinvested earnings of a direct investment
enterprise are, therefore, the direct investor’s share of
the direct investment enterprise’s retained earnings
or net saving (before reinvested earnings payable are
deemed distributed). Retained earnings or net saving
(before reinvested earnings payable are deemed distrib-
uted) of an enterprise may be formally stated as:

Net operating surplus (operating revenue minus
operating expenses)
+ Dividends receivable;
+ Interest receivable;
+ Rent receivable;
+ Enterprise’s share of reinvested earnings of any
direct investment enterprises;
+ Current transfers receivable;
–Dividends payable;
–Interest payable;
–Rent payable;
Taxes and other current transfers payable.
(These items correspond exactly to SNA items; addi-
tional information on the treatment of particular items
of revenue and expense can be found in the 2008 SNA .)
Reinvested earnings are recorded in the period in which
the retained earnings accrue. See also Box 11.5 for an
example of the calculation of reinvested earnings.
11.44 Reinvested earnings are measured on the basis
of net saving before reinvested earnings are deemed dis-
tributed, and thus linked to the concept of operational
earnings generated from production, lending and bor-
rowing financial assets, and renting natural resources,
and current transfers. Reinvested earnings do not include
any realized or unrealized holding gains or losses. Hold-
ing gains and losses may arise from valuation changes,
including exchange-rate-related gains and losses, revalu-
ation of fixed assets, and changes in market prices of
financial assets and liabilities. Reinvested earnings also
do not include gains or losses due to other changes in
volume of assets, such as write-offs of nonproduced,
nonfinancial assets, write-offs of bad debts, and uncom-
pensated seizures of assets. Because business accounting
measures of profits often include holding gains or losses,
adjustments to business accounting records may be nec-
essary. Holding gains and losses and other changes in
volume of financial assets and liabilities are described in
Chapter 9, Other Changes in Financial Assets and Lia-
bilities Account. Provisions for various types of losses,
such as for bad debts, are internal bookkeeping entries
that should not be taken into account in determining the
net saving and reinvested earnings.
11.45 Retained earnings of a direct investment
enterprise are measured after deducting corporate
taxes charged on the income of the enterprise. Such
taxes are payable by the enterprise and not by its
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

owners. Furthermore, retained earnings should be cal-
culated after any provision for consumption of fixed
capital. Consumption of fixed capital is measured by
the value, at current replacement cost, of the fixed
assets used up (as a result of physical deterioration,
normal obsolescence, or normal accidental damage)
during an accounting period. In the calculation of con-
sumption of fixed capital, the expected economic life
of an individual asset should be taken into account.
(Expected life and normal obsolescence or damage do
not include losses due to wars or major natural disas-
ters.) Depreciation used in the business accounts is not
necessarily the same as consumption of fixed capital
as the depreciation is usually based on historic cost
or book values. If data based on historic cost or book
values are used, they should be adjusted to current
replacement cost basis for the purpose of calculating
consumption of fixed capital.

11.46 Reinvested earnings can be negative when a
direct investment enterprise has a loss on its operations
or the dividends declared in a period are larger than net
income in that period. If direct investment abroad gen-
erates negative earnings, the entry should be shown as a
negative income receivable by the direct investor. Simi-

larly, the economy of the direct investment enterprise
should record the losses as negative income payable.
11.47 In a chain of direct investment relationships,
reinvested earnings need only be recorded between the
direct investor and directly owned direct investment enter-
prises. The passing of retained earnings from indirect
holdings should be taken into account through the chain
of direct investment relationships. Retained earnings of
an enterprise in the chain would include reinvested earn-
ings derived from its immediate direct investment enter-
prise (see paragraphs 6.8–6.24 for a definition of direct
investment relationships), which as a direct investor would
receive reinvested earnings from its immediate direct
investment enterprise, and so on. Therefore, reinvested
earnings are passed on to the indirect direct investors
through the chain indirectly, as illustrated in Box 11.1.

Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account
Enterprise A has a 100 percent subsidiary Enterprise B, which in turn has a 100 percent
subsidiary Enterprise C.
Enterprise A is owned 95 percent by portfolio investors, while Enterprise C owns 5 percent
(reverse investment).
In the following example, earnings are as stated and none of the enterprises pays dividends
during the period—all earnings are retained; so the following results are obtained for rein-
vested earnings:
Earnings from _____________________________Reinvested Earnings:
Own Operations Payable Receivable
Enterprise A 100 0 120
Enterprise B 40 120 80
Enterprise C 80 80 0
Notes:
The reinvested earnings receivable for Enterprise A consist of the reinvested earnings receivable
from its immediate direct investment enterprise, Enterprise B. However, the reinvested earnings
of Enterprise C are indirectly taken into account through reinvested earnings of Enterprise B. (See
paragraph 11.47.)
No reinvested earnings are payable on the reverse investment equity of Enterprise C in Enterprise A.
(See paragraph 11.99.)
Box 11.1. Reinvested Earnings with Chain of Ownership
11.48 Interest is a form of investment income that
is receivable by the owners of certain kinds of finan-
cial assets, namely deposits, debt securities, loans, and
other accounts receivable, for putting the financial
assets at the disposal of another institutional unit.
Income on SDR holdings and SDR allocations is also
included in interest. Not all current account flows asso-
ciated with debt instruments are interest; some may be
commissions or fees, which are charges for financial
services (see paragraphs 10.118–10.136 for a discussion
of financial services).

11.49 Interest is recorded on an accrual basis; that is,
interest is recorded as accruing continuously over time
to the creditor on the amount outstanding. Depending
on the contractual arrangements, the rate at which inter-
est accrues can be a percentage of the amount outstand-
ing, a predetermined sum of money, a variable sum of
money dependent on a defined indicator, or some com-
bination of these methods. Under the accrual basis, as
interest accrues, the amount outstanding increases; that
is, accrued interest not yet paid is a part of the amount
outstanding. What are commonly referred to as interest
payments, therefore, are financial account transactions
that reduce the debtor’s existing liability. The amount
initially advanced or borrowed is also known as initial
principal. Periodic coupon payments may cover part or
whole of the interest accrual during that period as well
as payments that reduce the initial principal.

a. Currency of denomination and
fixed-rate vs. index-linked instruments

11.50 For the purpose of defining and measuring
interest, it is useful to distinguish between the follow-
ing three types of arrangements:

(a) Domestic-currency-denominated fixed-rate
instruments. At inception, the contracting par-
ties determine all future cash flows that the
debtor must make in domestic currency. Interest
for these instruments is the difference between
the sum of all debtor’s payments and the funds
the creditor makes available to the debtor. The
information on the amount outstanding and
interest rates needed to calculate interest accru-
als is known at inception.
(b) Foreign-currency-denominated fixed-rate
instruments. At inception, future cash flows are
determined in the relevant foreign currency. The
recording of interest on foreign currency fixed-
rate instruments is also straightforward. Interest
is defined according to the formula described
in (a) above, with the only difference being
that, in the first instance, a foreign currency is
used as the currency of denomination. Interest
expressed in foreign currency is to be converted
into the domestic currency at the mid-point mar-
ket exchange rate for the periods in which the
interest accrues. The information on amount
outstanding and interest rates needed to calcu-
late interest accruals in the currency of denomi-
nation is known at inception. Debt instruments
with both the amount to be paid at maturity and
all periodic payments (such as coupons) linked
to a foreign currency are treated as though they
are denominated in that foreign currency.
(c) Index-linked instruments. The indexation mech-
anism links the amount to be paid at maturity or
periodic payments (such as coupons) (or both) to
indicators agreed by the parties, and the values
of the indicators are not known in advance. As
a result, the amount of interest cannot be known
at the time of issue. For some instruments, it can
be determined only at the time of redemption.
Indexed instruments include those indexed to the
consumer price index, a stock exchange index,
a commodity price, and so forth. Index-linked
debt instruments are those on which payments are
linked to a reference item that normally changes
over time in response to market pressures. All other
debt instruments should be classified as fixed-rate.
As noted in paragraph 11.50(b), debt instruments
with both the amount to be paid at maturity and
periodic payments linked to a foreign currency are
classified and treated as though they are denomi-
nated in that foreign currency. All other types of
index-linked instruments, including those that are
partially linked to exchange rates (e.g., those for
which either only the amount to be paid at matu-
rity or only periodic payments are linked to an
exchange rate), are treated as being denominated
in domestic currency for the recording of inter-
est and other economic flows. The calculation of
interest accrual for index-linked instruments is
described in paragraphs 11.59–11.65.
b. Interest on loans, deposits, and accounts
receivable/payable
11.51 The nature of financial assets and liabilities in
the form of deposits, loans, and accounts receivable/pay-
able is explained in Chapter 5, Classification of Financial
Assets and Liabilities. In general, the interest accrual
on these financial assets and liabilities is determined by
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

applying the relevant interest rate as specified in the con-
tractual arrangements between parties to the amount out-
standing at each point of time throughout the accounting
period. Some instruments have a fixed interest rate for
the entire life of the instrument. Some instruments may
have terms for changes in interest rates, once or several
times, during the life of the instrument. For each period,
the relevant interest rate should be used to calculate inter-
est accrued in that period. Some loans and deposits may
also have indexation of the amount to be paid at maturity
or periodic payments (or both). Interest accruals arising
from indexation as described in paragraphs 11.59–11.65
also apply to indexed loans and deposits.

c. Interest on debt securities—traded debt
instruments and concept of interest

11.52 Defining and measuring interest for traded
debt securities is not straightforward. While debtors
have obligations to settle according to the terms and
conditions set at the inception of the debt instruments,
holders of securities acquired in the secondary markets
may not know or even care about the interest rate at the
time of issue. There are three approaches for defining
and measuring interest for traded debt instruments:

(a) Interest is equal to the amounts the debtors will
have to pay to their creditors over and above
the repayment of the amounts advanced by the
creditors. Interest accrual on a debt instrument
is determined for the entire life by the condi-
tions set at inception of the instrument. Interest
accrual is determined using the original yield-to-
maturity. A single effective yield, established at
the time of security issuance, is used to calculate
the amount of accrued interest in each period
to maturity. This approach is also known as the
debtor approach.
(b) Interest is the income that follows from applying,
at any point in time, the discount rate of future
receivables implicit in the instrument’s market
value. The accrual of interest under this approach
reflects current market conditions and expecta-
tions. Interest accrual at any given time is deter-
mined using the current yield-to-maturity. The
effective interest rate for calculating the accrued
interest varies with period-to-period changes in
the market price of the securities. This approach
is also known as the creditor approach.
(c) Interest is the income that follows from applying
the discount rate implicit in the cost at which the
instrument was acquired. The accrual of inter-
est under this approach reflects market condi-
tions and expectations at the time of acquisition.
Interest is determined using the remaining yield-
to-maturity at the time the debt instrument is
acquired. The effective interest rate will change
only if the security is resold in the secondary
market. This approach is also known as the
acquisition approach.
11.53 In the international accounts, interest is
recorded following the first approach described above
in paragraph 11.52(a). The same approach is followed
in other macroeconomic statistical systems. Interest
calculated according to the market rates as described
in paragraph 11.52(b) may be reported as a supple-
mentary item, which is important particularly for ana-
lyzing rates of return. It should be noted that for debt
securities the valuation and recording of transactions
in the financial account and positions in the balance
sheets do not depend on the method used for the cal-
culation and recording of interest accrual. Acquisi-
tions and disposals of debt securities are recorded at
transaction prices and the positions are recorded at
market prices or fair values.
Debt securities with known cash flows
11.54 For debt securities for which the issue and
redemption prices are the same (i.e., issued at par), total
interest accruals over the whole life of the securities
are given by the periodic coupon payments. If coupon
payments are fixed, accrued interest can be calculated
by allocating the coupon payment to the relevant period
using a daily compound formula.
11.55 Certain debt securities, such as short-term
bills of exchange and zero-coupon bonds, are such
that the debtor is under no obligation to make any
payments to the creditor until the liability matures. In
effect, the debtor’s liability is discharged by a single
payment covering both the amount of the funds origi-
nally borrowed and the interest accrued and accumu-
lated over the entire life of the liability. Instruments
of this type are said to be discounted because the
amount initially borrowed is less than the amount to
be repaid. The difference between the amount to be
repaid at the end of the contract and the amount origi-
nally borrowed is interest that must be allocated over
the accounting periods between the beginning and end
of the contract. The interest accruing in each period
is recorded in the primary income account with the
same amount increasing the debtor’s liability for the
same instrument in the financial account. An example
is shown as Box 11.2.
Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account
11.56 A slightly more complicated case is a deep-
discount bond, which is a discounted instrument that
also requires periodic coupon payments. In such
cases, the interest accrual is the amount of the cou-
pon payable periodically plus the amount of interest
accruing in each period attributable to the difference
between the redemption price and the issue price.
Interest accrual from the periodic coupon payments
is derived as explained in paragraph 11.54. Inter-
est accrual from the amortization of the discount
(the difference between the issue and redemption
prices) can be calculated by summing daily amorti-
zations for the reporting period. Although amortiza-
tion rates could be calculated on monthly or quarterly
bases, amortization at a daily rate facilitates the allo-
cation of the amortized discount to the individual
reporting periods.

11.57 In some cases, debt securities are issued at
a premium rather than at a discount. The method of
determining the interest accrual is identical to the case
of a discounted instrument except that when issued at
a premium, the difference between the redemption and
issue price is amortized over the life of the instrument
and reduces (rather than increases as in the case of the
discounted instrument) the amount of interest accruing
in each period.
11.58 Stripped securities raise special issues for
accrual of interest. Unofficial strips are issued by a third
party without the authorization of the original issuer and,
hence, the stripped securities are new instruments—a
liability of the strip issuer. The original debt securi-
ties continue to accrue interest according to the term
specified in the contract. Interest on stripped securities
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

A bond is issued on January 1, Year 1, with 100 repayable in five years, with no coupons.
If the market rate of interest at the time of issue is 10 percent for that maturity and credit
rating, then the bond will be issued at a price of 62.09 (that is, 100/1.1^5 ).
The annual interest calculations and associated values of the principal are as follows:
_____________IIP _____________IIP
Value of Debt Income_____________ Value of Debt
Securities Interest Securities
January 1 Accrued December 31
Year 1 62.09 6.21 68.30
Year 2 68.30 6.83 75.13
Year 3 75.13 7.51 82.64
Year 4 82.64 8.26 90.91
Year 5 90.91 9.09 100.00
Notes:
According to the debtor approach (see paragraph 11.52(a)), the interest in each period is
fixed at inception.
The sum of interest over the five years is 37.91, equal to the difference between 62.09
(price at issue) and 100 (price at redemption).
Interest accr ued each year increases in line with the growing accumulated value of accr ued
interest.
The corresponding entry to the interest accrued is an increase in debt securities in the
financial account. The values of the bond during the period are unknown, because of hold-
ing gains and losses. While fluctuations in market interest rates will cause changes in the
value, the calculation of interest is unaffected.
(For further details, see External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users , para-
graph 2.66 and Table 2.3.)
Box 11.2. Numerical Example of Calculation of Interest Accrual on a
Zero-Coupon Bond
accrues at the rate determined at the time of issuance of
strips. Official strips (issued with the authorization of the
original issuer through a strip dealer it appoints) simply
change the arrangements for holding the original instru-
ment, and thus the strips remain the direct obligation of
the original issuer. Interest on official strips therefore
accrues at the rate on the underlying security, but not at
the rate prevailing at the time of stripping.

Index-linked debt securities
11.59 As explained in paragraph 11.50, an indexation
mechanism links the amount to be paid at maturity or
coupon payments (or both) to indicators agreed by the
parties. The values of the indicators are not known
in advance. For debt securities with indexation of the
amount to be paid at maturity, they may be known only
at the time of redemption. As a result, interest flows
before redemption are uncertain and cannot be deter-
mined with certainty. For estimating interest accru-
als before the values of the reference indicators are
known, some proxy measures will have to be used.
In this regard, it is useful to distinguish the following
three arrangements:

(a) indexation of coupon payments only with no
indexation of amount to be paid at maturity,
(b) indexation of the amount to be paid at maturity
with no indexation of coupon payments, and
(c) indexation of both the amount to be paid at matu-
rity and coupon payments.
The principles described in paragraphs 11.60–11.66 for
index-linked debt securities apply to all index-linked
debt instruments.

11.60 When only coupon payments are index-linked,
the full amount resulting from indexation is treated as
interest accruing during the period covered by the cou-
pon. It is most likely that by the time data are compiled
for a reporting period, the date for the coupon payment
would have been passed and hence the value of index
is known. When the date for the coupon payment has
not been passed, the movement in the index during that
part of the reporting period covered by the coupon can
be used to calculate the interest accrual.

11.61 When the amount to be paid at maturity
is index-linked, the calculation of interest accruals
becomes uncertain because the redemption value is
unknown; in some cases the maturity time may be
several years in the future. Two approaches can be fol-
lowed to determine the interest accrual in each account-
ing period:

(a) Interest accruing in an accounting period due to
the indexation of the amount to be paid at matu-
rity may be calculated as the change in the value
of this amount outstanding between the end and
beginning of the accounting period due to the
movement in the relevant index. (See Box 11.3
for an example.)
(b) Interest accruals may be determined by fixing the
rate of accrual at the time of issue. Accordingly,
interest is the difference between the issue price
and the market expectation, at inception, of all
payments that the debtor will have to make, which
is recorded as accruing over the life of the instru-
ment. This approach records as income the yield-
to-maturity at issuance, which incorporates the
results of the indexation that are foreseen at the
moment the instrument was created. Any devia-
tion of the underlying index from the originally
expected path leads to holding gains or losses that
will not normally cancel out over the life of the
instrument. (See Box 11.4 for an example.)
11.62 Although the first approach (using the move-
ment in the index) has the advantage of simplicity, inter-
est includes all changes and fluctuations in the value of
the amount to be paid at maturity in each accounting
period due to the movement in the relevant index. If
there is a large fluctuation in the index, this approach
may yield negative interest in some periods even though
market interest rates at the time of issue and current
period may be positive. Also, fluctuations behave like
holding gains and losses. The second approach (fixing
the rate at the time of issue) avoids such problems, but
the actual future cash flows may differ from the ini-
tially expected cash flows unless ex ante market expec-
tations are exactly met. This means that interest for the
life of the instrument may not be equal to the difference
between the issue price and redemption value.
11.63 The first approach works well when a broad-
based indexation of the amount to be paid at maturity
is used (e.g., a consumer price index or nominal GDP)
because such indexation is expected to change rela-
tively smoothly over time. However, the first approach
may give counter-intuitive results when the indexation
of the amount to be paid at maturity combines motives
for both interest income and holding gains (e.g., a nar-
row price index such as a commodity price, stock price,
or gold price). Therefore, when indexation includes a
holding gain motive, typically indexation based on a
single, narrowly defined item, the second approach is
preferred; otherwise the first approach should be used
for the measurement of interest accrual.
Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account
11.64 Because debt instruments with both the amount
to be paid at maturity and coupon payments indexed to
foreign currency are treated as though they are denomi-
nated in that foreign currency, interest, other economic
flows, and positions for these instruments should be
calculated using the same principles that apply to for-
eign-currency-denominated instruments. Interest should
accrue throughout the period using the foreign currency
as the currency of denomination and converted into the
domestic currency using mid-point market exchange
rates. Similarly, the amount outstanding should be val-
ued using the foreign currency as the unit of account
with the end of period exchange rate used to determine
the domestic currency value of the entire debt instru-
ment (including any accrued interest) in the international
investment position. Changes in market values of debt
securities due to exchange rate movements and interest
rate changes are treated as revaluations.

11.65 When both the amount to be paid at maturity
and coupon payments are indexed to a broad-based
reference item, interest accruals during an accounting

period can be calculated by summing two elements:
the amount resulting from the indexation of the cou-
pon payment (as described in paragraph 11.60) that is
attributable to the accounting period, and the change
in the value of the amount outstanding between the
end and beginning of the accounting period arising
from the movement in the relevant index (as described
in paragraph 11.61(a)). When both the amount to be
paid at maturity and coupon payments are indexed to
a narrow index that includes a holding gain motive,
interest accruals for any accounting period can be
determined by fixing the yield-to-maturity at issuance
as explained in paragraph 11.61(b).
Debt securities with embedded derivatives
11.66 For debt securities with embedded deriva-
tives, such as call, put, or equity conversion options,
the accounting for accrued interest is the same as for
securities that do not have such features. For all peri-
ods leading up to the exercise of the option, the inter-
est accrual is unaffected by the presence of the option.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

A bond is issued on Jan 1, Year 1 at a price 1000 for five years, with no coupons, indexed to
a broad price index. The index value at the beginning of the period is 100.
The index and bond values, with the derived interest and revaluations are as follows:
_______________Broad Price Index ________Bond
End of Period Interest Revaluation Dec. 31
Year 1 107.0 70 –12 1,058
Year 2 113.0 60 –17 1,101
Year 3 129.0 160 58 1,319
Year 4 148.0 190 10 1,519
__________________________________________________________________________________Year 5 140.3 –77 –39 1,403
Years 1–5 403 0
Notes:
Total interest over the five years (i.e., 403) is determined by the movement of the index
(i.e., 40.3 percent increase).
Since this is a bond, revaluations also arise because of changes in market conditions,
such as changes in market interest rates, credit ratings, and expectations about the future
path of the index. However, they are zero over the life of the bond when it is repaid at its
indexed value.
Negative values of interest can arise in the periods when the index declines.
The corresponding entry to the interest accrued is an increase in debt securities in the
financial account.
Fluctuations in market interest rates cause changes in the value of the bond, but the calcu-
lation of interest is unaffected.

When the embedded option is exercised, the securities
are redeemed and accrual of interest ceases.

d. Fees on securities lending and gold loans

11.67 Securities lending without cash collateral con-
sists of the delivery of securities for a given time period.
(This is discussed further in paragraphs 7.58–7.61.)
Usually the borrowers (e.g., brokers) subsequently on-
sell the securities outright to other clients. The ability
of the borrower to on-sell the securities reflects that
legal ownership is transferred to the borrower, while
the economic risks and rewards of ownership remain
with the original owner. In return, the “lender” receives
a fee from the “borrower” for the use of the security.
Gold loans consist of the delivery of gold for a given
time period. They may be associated with physical gold

or (less frequently) unallocated gold accounts. As with
securities lending, legal ownership of the gold is trans-
ferred (the temporary borrower may on-sell the gold to
a third party), but the risks and benefits of changes in
the gold price remain with the lender. Gold borrowers
(usually market dealers or brokers, but also gold pro-
ducers and industrial gold users) often use these trans-
actions to cover their sales to third parties in periods of
(temporary) gold shortage. A comparable fee is paid to
the original owner for the use of the gold. The amount
of the fee is determined by the value of the underlying
asset and the duration of the reverse transaction. War-
rants may also sometimes be lent.
11.68 Securities and monetary gold are financial
instruments and thus the fees for securities lending
without cash collateral and gold loans are payments
Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account
A bond is issued on Jan 1, Year 1 at a price 1000 for five years, with no coupons, indexed
to a narrow price index. The index value at the beginning of the period is 100. (The numbers
are the same as the example in Box 11.3, but the treatment differs because the narrow index
treatment is applied in Box 11.4.) Market interest rates are 8 percent per annum at the time
of issue.
The index and bond values, with the derived interest and revaluations are as follows:
_________________Narrow Price Index ________Bond
End of Period Interest Revaluation Dec. 31
Year 1 107.0 80 –22 1,058
Year 2 113.0 86 –43 1,101
Year 3 129.0 93 124 1,318
Year 4 148.0 101 100 1,519
__________________________________________________________________________________Year 5 140.3^109 –225 1,403
Years 1-5 469 –66
Notes:
The total increase in value over the five years (i.e., 469 – 66 = 403) is determined by the
movement of the index (i.e., 40.3 percent increase).
According to the debtor approach (see paragraph 11.52(a)), the interest in each period
is fixed according to the interest rate at inception. The interest for Year 1 is 80 (8 per-
cent of 1000), for Year 2 it is 86 (8 percent of 1000 + 80), for Year 3 it is 93 (8 percent of
1000 + 80 + 86), and so on.
The revaluation for the whole life of the bond is due to the difference between the increase
in the index and the compound increase that would have occurred at the market rate of
interest. (Revaluations also arise for individual periods during the life of the bond because
of changes in market conditions, such as changes in market interest rates, credit ratings,
and expectations about the future path of the index.)
Fluctuations in market interest rates cause changes in the value of the bond, but the calcu-
lation of interest is unaffected.
Box 11.4. Numerical Example of Calculation of Interest Accrual on an
Index-Linked Bond—Narrowly Based Index
for putting a financial instrument at the disposal of
another institutional unit. Accordingly, fees on securi-
ties lending (equity securities as well as debt securi-
ties) and gold loans accrue to the security owner and
are treated as interest (with the corresponding entry in
other accounts receivable/payable; see paragraph 5.73).
As a simplifying convention, fees paid on loans of non-
monetary gold are also treated as interest. For securi-
ties lending, although, in some circumstances, the fee
is payable to the custodian in the first instance (and
used to defray custodial charges, in whole or in part),
in principle, all of the fee is payable to the owner of the
security who, in turn, is deemed to pay part or all of
it to the custodian in a separate transaction. (Amounts
accruing to custodians are included under custodial ser-
vices, discussed under financial services in paragraphs
10.121 and 10.124.)

e. Investment income accrued while securities
are under reverse transactions

11.69 The economic owner of securities continues
to record dividends and the accrual of interest on the
securities even when the legal ownership changes under
a reverse transaction (see paragraph 7.58) or a cus-
todian has on-sold the securities to a third party (see
paragraph 10.124). If the reverse transaction covers
the period when dividends or coupons are payable, the
security taker is typically obliged to compensate the
security lender. (The payments to the security lender to
compensate for the dividends are called “manufactured
dividends.”) The treatment of the reverse positions is on
the research agenda.

f. Accrual of interest on nonperforming debt

11.70 Amount outstanding of nonperforming debt
remains a legal liability of the debtor, so interest should
continue to accrue unless the liability has been extin-
guished (e.g., by repayment or as a result of a bilateral
arrangement between debtor and creditor). However, for
some analysis, it may be more useful to exclude, from
primary income measures, interest that is not realisti-
cally expected to be paid. It would, therefore, be useful
for the creditor to provide supplementary information
on accrued interest on nonperforming debt when it is
significant and quantifiable. It is important that meta-
data should provide information on the method adopted
for defining nonperforming debt. Nonperforming loans
are described in paragraphs 7.50–7.53.

11.71 Following the accrual principle, arrears on debt
repayments (both periodic payments and amount to be

paid at maturity) that are not paid on due dates should
continue to be shown in the same instrument until the
liability is extinguished (see also paragraph 3.56). For
arrears arising from a debt contract, interest should
accrue at the same interest rate as on the original debt,
unless a different interest rate for arrears was stipulated
in the original debt contract, in which case this stipu-
lated interest rate should be used. The stipulated rate
may include a penalty rate in addition to the interest rate
on the original debt. If the terms and characteristics of
the financial instrument automatically change when it
goes into arrears, and if the classification of the loan is
changed, the change should be recorded as a reclassifica-
tion in the other changes in financial assets and liabilities
account (see paragraph 3.56 for treatment of arrears). If
the contract is renegotiated, transactions are recorded as
a new instrument is created. If an item is purchased on
credit and the debtor fails to pay within the period stated
at the time the purchase was made, any extra charges
incurred should be regarded as interest and accrue until
the debt is extinguished.
11.72 When a one-off guarantee covering a debt
that becomes nonperforming is activated, the guaran-
tor assumes the liability for that debt. From the time
of activation of the debt guarantee, the interest accrual
becomes the liability of the guarantor. A guarantor may
make payments for interest that are due on loans or
other interest-bearing liabilities of other units for which
it acts as the guarantor. Any interest accruing before the
guarantor assumes the debt is a liability of the original
debtor and payments by the guarantor should be classi-
fied on the basis of contractual arrangements between
the guarantor and the original debtor. In most cases,
such payments establish a claim by the guarantor on the
original debtor, who is obliged to service the debt. In
other cases, the claim on the debtor may be an increase
in the existing equity participation (e.g., the activation
of a guarantee made by a parent company for debt of
its subsidiary will improve the balance sheet of the
subsidiary and hence the parent company’s equity in it).
If the guarantor does not obtain a claim on the origi-
nal debtor, a capital transfer from the guarantor to the
debtor is recorded, particularly when the guarantor is a
government unit. The treatment of one-off guarantees
is described in paragraphs 8.42–8.45.
g. Interest on financial leases
11.73 Financial leases are defined and distinguished
from operating leases in paragraphs 5.56–5.58. The
implication of treating financial leases as a loan is that
interest accrues on the loan. The lessor is treated as
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

making a loan to the lessee equal to the market value
of the asset, this loan being gradually paid off over the
period of the lease. The rate of interest on the imputed
loan is implicitly determined by the total amount pay-
able in rentals over the life of the lease in relationship to
the market value of the asset at the time of lease initia-
tion. The initial loan to the lessee, together with the les-
see’s subsequent repayments of the loan, are recorded
in the financial account of the lessor and lessee. The
interest payable on the loan is recorded in the primary
income account. (A numerical example of calculation
of items for financial leases is shown in Box A6b.1.)

h. Pure interest (excluding FISIM)

11.74 Typically, financial intermediaries offer lower
rates of interest to their depositors than the rates that
they charge to their borrowers. The resulting inter-
est margins are used by the financial intermediaries
to defray their expenses and to provide an operating
surplus. This method of operation is an alternative to
charging customers directly for services. The treatment
of this margin (FISIM—financial intermediation ser-
vices indirectly measured) and its measurement are
described in paragraphs 10.126–10.136.

11.75 The primary income account records “pure
interest” by eliminating the FISIM component from
“actual interest.” “Actual interest” payable to a finan-
cial intermediary includes the service charge, which
should be subtracted to give the interest recorded as
investment income in the international accounts. Simi-
larly, “actual interest” receivable from a financial inter-
mediary is seen as having had a service charge already
deducted, so the actual interest receivable from the
financial intermediary will be increased by the value
of the service received to provide interest recorded as
investment income in the international accounts. The
“pure interest” is calculated using the reference inter-
est rate. The concept of “reference” interest rate and its
application are described in paragraphs 10.129–10.130.
Actual interest charged or received by banks is needed
for certain analytical purposes (for instance, for debt
sustainability analysis and analysis of rates of return)
and should be disseminated as a memorandum item.

i. Interest under high inflation

11.76 High inflation gives rise to specific issues in
measuring and interpreting interest. An obvious example
is that interest rates for domestic-currency-denominated
instruments could be significantly higher than those for
foreign-currency-denominated instruments. Thus, nomi-

nal interest for domestic-currency-denominated instru-
ments includes compensation for the loss of purchasing
power on the monetary value of the funds advanced. The
topic of accounting under high inflation is important and
more pervasive in the accounts than simply the ques-
tion of how to measure interest in these circumstances.
Indeed, the whole issue of the measurement of transac-
tions on a current price basis is called into question when
prices at the end of the period are several times those at
the start of the period. Chapter 29, Satellite Accounts
and Other Extensions, of the 2008 SNA provides guid-
ance on compiling and presenting data in conditions of
inflation, covering the whole range of issues from the
goods and services account, through income and finan-
cial accounts, to balance sheets.
5. Investment income attributable to
policyholders in insurance, standardized
guarantees, and pension funds

11.77 Investment income attributable to policy-
holders in insurance, standardized guarantees, and
pension funds represents returns to policyholders on
their claims in insurance and standardized guarantee
schemes in the form of technical reserves and income
payable on pension entitlements.
11.78 The operations of insurance corporations,
standardized guarantee schemes, and pension funds
include charging premiums, paying claims, and manag-
ing and investing funds. However, the observed trans-
actions do not always reflect the underlying economic
relationships between the insurance corporations or
pension funds and policyholders, and it is necessary to
rearrange these operations so that the underlying eco-
nomic behavior is reflected in the economic accounts.
One such rearrangement is the imputation of invest-
ment income attributable to policyholders in insurance
corporations, standardized guarantee schemes, and
pension funds. The measurement of these services is
described in paragraphs 10.109–10.117.
11.79 Insurance corporations, standardized guaran-
tees schemes, and pension funds hold technical reserves
to meet obligations arising from claims and entitle-
ments. The definition and classification of these tech-
nical reserves are described in paragraphs 5.62–5.63
and 7.63–7.68. The technical reserves and entitlements
represent a liability of the insurer, issuer of standard-
ized guarantees, and defined benefit pension fund, and a
corresponding asset of the policyholders and beneficia-
ries. To meet their technical reserve liabilities, the insur-
ers, guarantors, and pension funds make investments in
Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account
various assets, such as financial assets, land, or build-
ings. However, the investments by insurers, guarantors,
and pension funds are not necessarily equal to the tech-
nical reserves and entitlements.

11.80 For nonlife insurance policies, the technical
reserves represent prepayment of premiums and reserves
against outstanding claims. Guarantors have technical
provisions for calls under standardized guarantees. The
investment income on these technical reserves is treated
as income attributable to the policyholders.

11.81 For life insurance, the insurers’ liability equals
the present value of expected claims from existing poli-
cyholders. Set against these liabilities, the insurance
corporations hold assets, and the income earned by
insurance corporations from these assets is attributed to
the policyholders as investment income on their claims
on life insurance corporations. (See paragraph A6c.33
for further information.)

11.82 For defined contribution pension schemes, the
investment income payable on pension entitlements is
measured in the same way as for the investment income
attributable to insurance policyholders (i.e., equal to the
investment income on funds plus any income earned
by renting land and buildings owned by the fund). For
the defined benefit pension schemes, because the value
of entitlements is the present value of future payments,
the investment income payable on pension entitlements
is measured as the increase in benefits payable because
the date when the entitlements become payable is closer.
The amount of the increase is not affected by whether
the pension scheme actually has sufficient funds to meet
all the obligations nor by how it is funded (whether from
investment income or holding gains, for example). (In
contrast, changes in model assumptions are recorded
under other changes in volume—see paragraph 9.24.)

11.83 Investment income attributable to policyhold-
ers is retained by the insurance corporations, guar-
antors, and pension funds in practice. It is therefore
treated as being paid back by the policyholders to the
insurance corporations, guarantors, and pension funds
in the form of premium supplements that are additional
to actual premiums payable under the terms of the insur-
ance and pension policies. The corresponding entries to
the investment income attributable to insurance policy-
holders for casualty insurance, including standardized
guarantees, are called premium supplements and taken
into account in deriving service charges and net premi-
ums. (See paragraphs 12.41–12.42 and Appendix 6c,
Topical Summary—Insurance, Pension Schemes, and
Standardized Guarantees.)

11.84 The total amount of investment income attribut-
able to policyholders is allocated among policyholders.
The allocation to policyholders could be made in propor-
tion to actual premiums payable by them. Investment
income payable by resident insurers, guarantors, and pen-
sion funds to nonresident policyholders can be estimated
by multiplying the gross premiums earned from non-
residents by the ratio of investment income attributable
to policyholders to gross premiums earned for all opera-
tions. To the extent that these ratios vary for different
lines of business (reinsurance, marine, life, pension funds,
standardized guarantees, etc.), the calculations should be
made separately. Such investment income receivable by
resident policyholders from nonresident insurers, guaran-
tors, and pension funds is not readily observable. Ratios
of investment income attributable to policyholders to pre-
miums that are observed in other similar cases could be
used to calculate investment income receivable.
6. Rent

Reference:
2008 SNA, Chapter 7, The Distribution of Income
Accounts.
11.85 Rent covers income receivable for putting nat-
ural resources at the disposal of another institutional
unit. The party providing the natural resource is called
the lessor or landlord, while the user is called the lessee
or tenant. The terms under which rent is payable are
expressed in a resource lease. A resource lease is an
agreement whereby the legal owner of a natural resource
that has an infinite life makes it available to a lessee in
return for a regular payment recorded as rent.
11.86 Examples of rent include amounts payable for
the use of land extracting mineral deposits and other
subsoil assets, and for fishing, forestry, and grazing
rights. The regular payments made by the lessees of nat-
ural resources such as subsoil assets are often described
as royalties, but they are classified as rents. Payments or
receipts by government of rent on land without build-
ings (e.g., for military bases) should be shown as rent,
not as government goods and services n.i.e. If a single
payment covers both the return on land and structures
on it and there is no objective basis on which to split the
payment for the use of land and structures, the whole
amount should be treated as rent when the value of land
is believed to exceed the value of structures, and as
purchase of services (rental) otherwise.
11.87 Usually, the entity using land or natural
resources is a resident institutional unit. However, if the
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

user is a nonresident then a cross-border transaction on
rent arises. For example, a forestry or fishing operation
that pays for temporary access to naturally growing
fish or timber in another economic territory gives rise
to rent in the international accounts. It is also possible
that other natural resources adjoining a border could be
extracted from a base on the other side of the border,
thus giving rise to rent. Payments for overflight rights
are also rent, unless they relate primarily to air traffic
control, in which case they would be other transport
services. Rent arrangements can be contrasted with:

(a) outright ownership of the resources concerned,
which would be recorded as an international
transaction in a natural resource (see paragraph
13.9) or, more likely, give rise to a notional direct
investment enterprise that owns the resource
(paragraphs 4.34–4.40); or
(b) when the right to use an asset amounts to an
economic asset but not outright ownership of
the underlying asset, the purchase and sale are
classified under contracts, leases, and licenses
(e.g., a right to use a natural resource for 10
years, such as a spectrum license; see paragraph
13.11); or
(c) rentals, which represent charges for the use of
fixed assets, such as houses and machinery (see
paragraphs 10.153–10.157 on rentals arising from
operating leases).
11.88 Notional direct investment enterprises created
for holding land and leases on land for long periods will
normally generate rent (or travel or operational leasing
services if there is a building on the land). Notional units
are described in paragraphs 4.34–4.40. When the land or
buildings are used by the owners (who are nonresidents)
of the notional unit, an imputation for rent (in the case
of use of land) or travel services (e.g., in territories that
had a large number of vacation homes owned by nonresi-
dents) or operational leasing (if nonresident enterprises
own premises for their own use) would be necessary.
These imputations are recorded under relevant catego-
ries of the current account. The income arising from the
notional direct investment enterprise is recorded under
direct investment income. For example, if the vacation
home is rented, the notional unit receives the payment for
accommodation and generates net earnings that are con-
sidered withdrawals from income of quasi-corporations,
generated by the provision of accommodation services.

11.89 Rent is recorded on an accrual basis; that is,
rent is treated as accruing continuously to the owner
throughout the period of the contract agreed between

the owner and the user. The rent recorded for a particu-
lar accounting period is, therefore, equal to the value of
the accumulated rent payable over that period of time,
as distinct from the amount of rent due to be paid dur-
ing that period or the rent actually paid. An up-front
rent payment covering several periods gives rise to a
financial asset of the lessee and liability of the lessor,
classified under accounts receivable/payable. Similarly,
a payment after the rent period(s) gives rise to other
accounts receivable/payable.
11.90 If a lessee subleases a natural resource, the
income from the subleasing should be classified as rent,
as should the income payable to the owner of the natu-
ral resource by the owner of the lease.
7. Taxes and subsidies on products and
production^3

11.91 Taxes and subsidies on products and produc-
tion are included in the primary income account. (See
paragraphs 10.180–10.181 for distinction between taxes
and services.) Taxes on income and wealth are included
in the secondary income account (see paragraphs 12.28–
12.31 for taxes on income and wealth). Cross-border
taxes and subsidies on products and production are nor-
mally not significant except perhaps in economic unions.
They arise if an international or regional organization
levies its own taxes or pays subsidies (which may also
be done through national governments). They may also
arise when economic activity by nonresidents (such as
short-term construction or installation projects) is insuf-
ficient to constitute a branch. Although taxes on products
may be levied at various stages (production, distribution,
or use), they are included in the prices of goods and ser-
vices. Therefore, for purchasers, the prices paid include
relevant taxes on products, while for governments such
taxes are considered primary income.
11.92 Taxes and subsidies on products and produc-
tion should be recorded in the primary income account
to maintain the conceptual consistency with SNA. The
2008 SNA distinguishes between
(a) Taxes on products, which are payable per unit of
a good or service. Examples include value-added
tax, import duties, export taxes, and excise; and
(b) Other taxes on production. Examples include
payroll taxes, recurrent taxes on buildings and
land, and business licenses.
(^3) This item corresponds to the 2008 SNA ’s “Taxes on production
and on imports” and “Subsidies.”
Chapter 11 g Primary Income Account

The same distinction is made for subsidies. As men-
tioned in paragraph 11.4, the balance on the primary
income account makes up the difference between GDP
and GNI. Subsidies are shown separately from taxes,
rather than being deducted from taxes.

11.93 In some cases, an exporter of a good con-
tractually agrees to pay import duties. In such cases,
the duties are outside the scope of the primary distri-
bution of income in the international accounts. This
treatment is adopted because the duties arise from the
process of importation, and so they are an obligation
of the importer. They are, therefore, treated as pay-
able by the importer, and so are resident-to-resident
transactions. The amount of import duties paid by the
exporter, therefore, is not included in the FOB value of
the goods. (Because the tax is imputed as being paid
by the importer, it is a resident-to-resident transaction.)
Similarly, if an importer agrees to pay export taxes, the
tax is still an obligation of the exporter. The amount
of the export tax paid by the importer, therefore, is
included in the FOB value of the goods and rerouted
through the exporter. (See also paragraph 10.34.) (This
treatment is the same as applies to arrangements to pay
freight and insurance services.)

11.94 In some circumstances, a duty or other tax
may be imposed by the customs authorities without
ownership being acquired by a resident of that terri-
tory. Examples may include goods to be processed,
repaired, or stored, or for use by visitors. In such cases,
when customs duties are payable by nonresidents, the
duties are recorded as taxes on products payable by
nonresidents.

C. Investment Income and Functional Categories
11.95 This section deals with investment income
that is included under each functional category of
financial assets and liabilities. It also discusses specific
issues related to investment income for a functional
asset category. A functional asset category includes
different types of financial instruments that serve the
same function, and hence a functional category can
include different types of investment income. Financial
derivatives and employee stock options do not give rise
to investment income.

1. Direct investment income

11.96 Direct investment income includes all
investment income arising from direct investment

positions between resident and nonresident insti-
tutional units. As noted in paragraph 6.28, debt
between selected affiliated financial intermediaries
is not included in direct investment, so the corre-
sponding income on those instruments is also clas-
sified as portfolio or other investment income. Rare
cases of other primary income, such as compensation
of employees and rent between direct investors and
direct investment enterprises, are not included under
direct investment income.
11.97 Direct investment relationships are defined in
paragraphs 6.8–6.24. Three types of direct investment
relationships and associated investment income flows
can be distinguished:
(a) Direct investors’ investment in direct investment
enterprises. This category includes investment
income flows (distributed earnings, reinvested
earnings, and interest) between the direct inves-
tor and its direct investment enterprises (whether
in an immediate relationship or not).
(b) Reverse investment (defined in paragraph 6.40).
This type of relationship covers investment income
flows on liabilities of direct investors to their direct
investment enterprises and on claims of direct
investment enterprises on their direct investors.
(c) Between fellow enterprises. This covers invest-
ment income flows between all fellow enter-
prises that belong to the same direct investment
group.
Dividends, withdrawals from income of quasi-
corporations, and interest can apply for any of these
types of direct investment relationships. Reinvested
earnings are attributed to direct investors only when
equity participation by the direct investor meets the 10
percent threshold. A numerical example of the calcula-
tion of reinvested earnings is given in Box 11.5.
11.98 Investment income associated with various
types of financial instruments is discussed in Section
B above. Table 11.2 shows various types of investment
income by three types of direct investment relation-
ship.^4 Interest can be broken down further by type of
financial instruments. The possibility of a detailed
presentation of direct investment income as shown in
Table 11.2 not only allows explicit links to financial
instruments but also expands the analytical value of the
(^4) Note that the titles in Table 11.2 refer to the position to which the
income flows relate, so the heading “direct investors in direct invest-
ment enterprises” refers to investment income payable to direct
investors by their direct investment enterprises.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

data for detailed analysis of direct investment relation-
ships. However, the second and third categories may be
insignificant or confidential in some cases, allowing
for dissemination of only aggregate data for all three
types combined.

Income on reverse investment

11.99 Reverse investment is defined in paragraph
6.40. Investment income on reverse investment is
shown on a gross basis. That is, both the income receiv-
able from claims on direct investors and income pay-
able on liabilities to direct investment enterprises are
shown separately. However, income data may also be
presented according to the directional principle on a
supplementary basis. There are no reinvested earnings
on reverse equity because the 10 percent threshold has
not been met.

Income on investment between fellow
enterprises
11.100 There are no reinvested earnings on equity
between fellow enterprises because the 10 percent
threshold has not been met. The treatment of fellow
enterprises in income data presented according to the
directional principle is discussed in paragraph 6.43 and
Box 6.4.
Transfer pricing
11.101 Transfer pricing at values that differ signifi-
cantly from arm’s length prices is usually associated
with shifting resources between related enterprises,
so it relates to direct investment income measures.
Transfer pricing may be motivated by income distri-
bution or equity buildups or withdrawals. Examples
may be the provision of goods and services without

Total expenses (8 through 15) 22,000
Net income (before taxes) 12,500
Taxes on income 4,000
Net income (after taxes) 8,500
Dividends payable 5,000
Reinvested earnings can be derived by:
(a) Adjusting net income after taxes:
Net income after taxes (line 19 = 8,500)
dividends (line 20 = 5,000)
revenue not part of output, primary income or second-
ary income (namely, holding gains, line 6 = 1,000)
expenses not being a transaction (namely, bad debt
provisions, line 15 = 2,000)
= 4,500, multiplied by 0.5
= 2,250.
(b) From the national accounting relationships
output of goods and services (line 1 + line 2 + line 3;
which gives 29,500);
intermediate consumption of goods and services;
(line 8 + line 10 + line 11 + line 12; which gives
13,000)
consumption of fixed capital (line 13, which gives
1,000) (Assumes depreciation is an acceptable approx-
imation to consumption of fixed capital. Aggregate
adjustments may be possible if it is not.)
primary and secondary income receivable (line 4 +
line 5, which gives 4,000);
primary and secondary income payable (line 9 + line
14 + line 18 + line 20; which gives 15,000)
all multiplied by the direct investor’s share in the
equity of the enterprise
= 4,500 multiplied by 0.5
= 2,250
In practice, data for these calculations may not always
be available monthly or quarterly, or may not be available
for the most recent period(s). As a result, it may be neces-
sary to derive some items from partial data or by methods,
such as extrapolation, ratios, and models.

explicitly charging, or at understated or overstated
values. Where transfer pricing is identified and quan-
tified with a high degree of certainty, the relevant
entry should be adjusted to an arm’s length value (see
also paragraphs 3.77–3.78). Compilers in each of the
economies involved are encouraged to cooperate and
exchange information in order to avoid asymmetrical
recordings of bilateral data. In addition to the adjust-
ment to the flow itself, there should be a correspond-
ing entry, as stated below:

(a) if a direct investment enterprise is overinvoiced
on a good or service provided by the direct inves-
tor or
(b) if a direct investor is underinvoiced on a good
or service provided by the direct investment
enterprise,
then the transfer pricing acts as a hidden dividend from
the direct investment enterprise, so dividends should
be increased by the difference between the market
value of the goods and services and the prices actually
charged:
(a) if a direct investment enterprise is underinvoiced
on a good or service provided by the direct inves-
tor or
(b) if a direct investor is overinvoiced on a good
or service provided by the direct investment
enterprise,
then the transfer pricing acts as a hidden investment
in the direct investment enterprise, so direct invest-
ment equity flows should be increased by the difference
between the market value of the goods and services and
the prices actually charged.

11.102 The adjustments for transfer pricing have
implications for reinvested earnings and for data of
the counterpart economy. It is, therefore, useful to
exchange information to the extent possible with
counterpart economies in order to avoid asymmetrical
recordings.

2. Portfolio investment income

11.103 Portfolio investment income includes income
flows between residents and nonresidents arising from
positions in equity and debt securities other than those
classified under direct investment or reserve assets.
Financial instruments covered in portfolio investment
are described in paragraphs 6.54–6.57.

11.104 Two types of portfolio investment income
are distinguished at the first level, namely, income
on equity securities and investment fund shares, and
income on debt securities. The income on investment
fund shares includes both dividends and reinvested
earnings. Income on equity securities other than invest-
ment fund shares includes only distributed earnings
(dividends). Interest is further classified by types of
debt security and by maturity. Such a detailed classifica-
tion of portfolio investment income ensures consistency
with both instrument and functional classifications of
financial assets and liabilities.

11.105 Portfolio investment income can be further
classified by domestic institutional sectors (see Chapter
4, Economic Territory, Units, Institutional Sectors, and

Residence; Section D, Institutional Sectors) for owners
of securities as well as issuers of securities. A variety of
other supplementary disaggregations by foreign sector,
currency of denomination, and so forth may be desir-
able for specific analytical purposes.
3. Other investment income

11.106 Other investment income covers flows
between resident and nonresident institutional units
in regard to interest on deposits, loans, trade credit
and advances, and other accounts receivable/payable;
income on equity and investment fund shares that are
not classified in any other functional categories; and
investment income attributable to policyholders in
insurance, standardized guarantees, and pension funds.
Interest payable on SDR allocations is also recorded
under other investment income. Fees for nonmonetary
gold loans should also be included in interest under
other investment income (see paragraph 11.68). Table
11.3 shows various types of other investment income
and associated financial instruments.
11.107 Other investment income on equity excludes
income on direct investment equity and portfolio
investment in equity securities. Equity participation in
some incorporated or unincorporated enterprises (such
as partnership or joint ventures) does not qualify either
as direct investment (because the equity participation is
below the 10 percent threshold) or as portfolio invest-
ment (because they are not equity securities). Such

equity participation is classified under other investment
(see also paragraphs 5.26 and 6.62) and any income
distributed to the owners should be classified in other
investment income. Similarly, some investment funds
may be organized by and limited to a small number
of members, but may not meet the definition of direct
investment or portfolio investment. Both distributed
and reinvested earnings on such investment fund shares
are classified under other investment income.

11.108 Other investment income should be further
classified by type of financial instruments. It can also
be classified by the domestic institutional sectors (for
both income receivable on holdings of external assets
and income payable on external liability positions).

4. Income on reserve assets

11.109 Data on income on reserve assets is useful for
studying rates of return on reserves, and for ensuring
that rates of return on other categories exclude reserves.

Investment income on reserve assets includes income
on equity and investment fund shares, and interest. Fees
on security lending and monetary gold loans (as dis-
cussed in paragraph 11.67) and interest on unallocated
gold accounts (as discussed in paragraph 6.80) are also
included under interest on reserve assets. Income on
equity and investment fund shares can be further clas-
sified into dividends on equity securities and income
attributable to investment fund shareholders. The lat-
ter includes both distributed and reinvested earnings.
Interest receivable can also be further classified by type
of financial instruments. If not available for publica-
tion, income from reserve assets should be included in
other investment–interest.
11.110 Interest on SDR holdings is shown on a gross
basis under income on reserve assets. That is, the value
of interest payable on SDR allocations is not deducted.
(Interest payable on SDR allocations is shown as
income under other investment liabilities, as stated in
paragraph 11.106.)

Chapter 12. Secondary Income Account
A. Overview of the Secondary Income Account
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 8, The Redistribution of Income
Accounts.

12.1 The secondary income account shows current
transfers between residents and nonresidents. Various
types of current transfers are recorded in this account
to show their role in the process of income distribution
between the economies. Transfers may be made in cash
or in kind. Capital transfers are shown in the capital
account (see paragraphs 13.19–13.34).

12.2 Whereas primary income affects national
income (see paragraph 11.4 for the definition of gross
national income), secondary income, together with pri-
mary income, affects gross national disposable income.
Capital transfers do not affect disposable income and,
hence, are recorded in the capital account.

12.3 The balance on the secondary income account
presents total credits less total debits, and is called
balance on secondary income. In addition, the balance
of the sum of all current account transactions can also
be shown at the end of this account because it is the
last account in the sequence of current accounts. The
balance on all current accounts is called the current
account balance, an important economic aggregate in
analyzing external imbalance. The current account bal-
ance also links to the national accounts as it is equal
to the saving-investment balance for the economy (see
paragraphs 14.4–14.5).

12.4 The components and structure of the second-
ary income account are shown in Table 12.1. Current
transfers can be further classified by institutional
sectors receiving or providing the transfers. In some
cases, compilers may be interested in compiling data
classified by sector of provider for credits and sec-

tor of recipient for debits. For economies that are
major recipients of assistance, it would be desirable
to show current and capital transfers with consistent
classifications to allow them to be compared and
aggregated.
B. Concepts and Coverage
12.5 In describing the content of the secondary
income account, two important distinctions are made:
(a) transfers are distinguished from other types of
transactions (see paragraphs 12.6–12.11) and (b) cur-
rent transfers are distinguished from capital transfers
(see paragraphs 12.12–12.15).
1. Transactions: exchanges and transfers
12.6 As explained in paragraph 3.13, every transac-
tion is either an exchange or a transfer. An exchange
involves a provision of something of economic value in
return for a corresponding item of economic value.
12.7 A transfer is an entry that corresponds to the
provision of a good, service, financial asset, or other
nonproduced asset by an institutional unit to another
institutional unit when there is no corresponding return
of an item of economic value. Transfers can also arise
where the value provided in return for an item is not
economically significant or is much below its value.
The accounting system in the international accounts
requires that each party to a transaction record two
entries (see paragraphs 3.26–3.31 for the description of
the accounting system). When something of economic
value (e.g., goods, services, or a financial asset) is pro-
vided without a corresponding return of an item of
economic value, the corresponding entry is made as a
transfer. A cash transfer consists of the payment of cur-
rency or transferable deposit by one institutional unit to
another without anything supplied in return. A transfer
in kind consists of either the transfer of ownership of a

good or asset, other than cash, or the provision of a ser-
vice, again without any corresponding return of an item
of economic value. A transfer is classified as a current
or capital transfer (see paragraphs 12.12–12.15).

12.8 A unit making a transfer receives no specific
quantifiable benefit in return that can be recorded as
part of the same transaction. Nevertheless, certain
transfers (e.g., net nonlife insurance premiums) may
entitle the unit making the payment to some contingent
future benefits. Taxes are usually used to provide cer-
tain collective services that the taxpayers may be able
to consume. Even in the context of taxes payable by
residents, such benefits are generally uncertain or not
quantifiable, and hence items such as net nonlife insur-
ance premiums and taxes other than those on products
and production are treated as transfers. Taxes on prod-
ucts and production are, however, treated as primary
income. (See paragraphs 11.91–11.94.)

12.9 The borderline between transfers and exchanges
may, in some cases, be unclear. The distinction between
taxes and charges for government services is one such
case. Paragraphs 12.30 and 10.180–10.181 provide the
guidelines for distinguishing taxes from services. Another
case is the distinction between personal transfers and
compensation of employees when individuals go abroad
for employment. The distinction between the recording
of one or the other of these transactions is based on the
nature of the transaction and how long the individuals
stay in the economic territories where they are work-
ing, that is, whether they are considered residents of the

economies where they are working. Similarly, a case of
distinction between financial transactions and personal
transfers is described in paragraph 12.24.
12.10 A nonprofit institution serving households
(NPISH, as defined in paragraph 4.100) may be a direct
investor in a corporation. However, flows between two
NPISHs are generally transfers, rather than investment,
because it is considered that flows in these cases are
seldom driven by commercial considerations.
12.11 Transfers do not generally arise between com-
mercial entities. For example, provision of goods and
services without an explicit charge or at understated
value between institutional units in a direct invest-
ment relationship does not represent a transfer. In this
instance, the corresponding entry is in direct invest-
ment equity (see paragraphs 11.101–11.102). However,
net nonlife insurance premiums and nonlife insurance
claims are transfers that may occur between commer-
cial entities. Likewise, a commercial entity may be
involved in the provision of current or capital transfer to
another commercial entity as a compensation for dam-
ages to properties or other losses.
2. Distinction between current and
capital transfers
12.12 Transfers may be either current or capital.
To avoid duplication, the distinction between current
and capital transfers is discussed primarily in this
chapter rather than in Chapter 13, Capital Account. To

distinguish current transfers from capital transfers, it
is preferable to focus on the special characteristics of
capital transfers.

12.13 Capital transfers are transfers in which the
ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories)
changes from one party to another; or that oblige
one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset
(other than cash or inventories); or where a liability
is forgiven by the creditor. Cash transfers involving
disposals of noncash assets (other than inventories)
or acquisition of noncash assets (other than inven-
tories) are also capital transfers. A capital trans-
fer results in a commensurate change in the stocks
of assets of one or both parties to the transaction
without affecting the saving of either party. Capital
transfers are typically large and infrequent, but capital
transfers cannot be defined in terms of size or fre-
quency. A transfer in kind without a charge is a capital
transfer when it consists of (a) the transfer of owner-
ship of a nonfinancial asset (other than inventories,
i.e., fixed assets, valuables, or nonproduced assets) or
(b) the forgiveness of a liability by a creditor when no
corresponding value is received in return. However,
capital equipment provided by a direct investor to its
direct investment enterprise is not a capital transfer,
but involves a transaction in direct investment equity.
A transfer of cash is a capital transfer when it is linked
to, or conditional on, the acquisition or disposal of a
fixed asset by one or both parties to the transaction
(e.g., an investment grant).

12.14 Current transfers consist of all transfers that
are not capital transfers. Current transfers directly
affect the level of disposable income and influence
the consumption of goods or services. That is, current
transfers reduce the income and consumption possibili-
ties of the donor and increase the income and consump-
tion possibilities of the recipient. For example, social
benefits and food aid are current transfers.

12.15 It is possible that some cash transfers may be
regarded as capital by one party to the transaction and
as current by the other party. A large economy that
regularly makes investment grants in cash to a number
of smaller economies may regard the outlays as cur-
rent, even though they may be specifically intended to
finance the acquisition of assets. So that a donor and a
recipient do not treat the same transaction differently, a
transfer should be classified as capital for both parties
even if it involves the acquisition or disposal of an asset,
or assets, by only one of the parties. When there is
doubt about whether a transfer should be treated as cur-
rent or capital, it should be treated as a current transfer.

The treatment of nonlife insurance claims as current or
capital is discussed in paragraphs 12.44–12.45.
3. Recording and valuation of transfers
12.16 Although no good, service, or asset is received
in return from the counterpart, the recording of a trans-
fer nevertheless must give rise to two entries for each
party to the transaction. For a transfer in cash, the
donor records a decrease in currency or deposits and
a transfer payable; the recipient records an increase in
currency or deposits and a transfer receivable. For a
provision of goods or services in kind without a charge,
the donor records an export of goods or services and
a transfer payable; the recipient records an import of
goods or services and a transfer receivable. When a
liability is forgiven, the creditor and debtor extinguish
the financial asset and liability, respectively, with the
corresponding entries recorded as transfers.
12.17 In general, the time of recording of transfers is
determined by the time of the change of economic own-
ership of the resources (such as goods, services, finan-
cial assets) that are corresponding entries to transfers.
Determining the time of recording for grants and other
voluntary transfers can be complex because there is a
wide variety of eligibility conditions that have various
legal powers. In some cases, a potential transfer recipi-
ent has a legal claim when certain conditions have been
satisfied, such as the prior incurrence of expenses for
a specific purpose or the passage of legislation. These
transfers are recorded when all requirements and con-
ditions are satisfied. In cases where the transfer recipi-
ent never has a claim on the donor, the transfer should
be attributed to the time at which the cash payment is
made, the asset conveyed, or liability forgiven.

12.18 Taxes and other compulsory transfers should
be recorded when the activities, transactions, or other
events occur that create the government’s claim to the
taxes or other payments. The time of recording of taxes
is the time at which tax liability arises. Accordingly,
the amount of taxes is determined by the amount due
for payment as evidenced by tax assessments, decla-
rations, or other instruments, such as sales invoices
or customs declarations, that create liabilities in the
form of obligations to pay on the part of taxpayers.
Some compulsory transfers, such as fines, penalties,
and property forfeitures, are determined at a specific
time. These transfers are recorded when a legal claim
to the funds is established, which may be when a court
renders judgment or an administrative ruling is pub-
lished. If data on taxes are on a cash basis, adjustments
Chapter 12 g Secondary Income Account
should be made for large differences to approximate the
accrual basis of recording.

12.19 Because a transfer is the corresponding entry
to an actual resource flow or a forgiven liability, the
value of the transfer equals the value of the corre-
sponding flow. Generally, transfers in kind give rise to
valuation difficulties for the actual resource flow and,
accordingly, also the corresponding transfer entries.
The principles for the valuation of in-kind transactions
are described in paragraph 3.72.

C. Types of Current Transfers
12.20 The international accounts classify the fol-
lowing types of current transfers:

Personal transfers

Other current transfers

(a) current taxes on income, wealth, etc.,
(b) social contributions,
(c) social benefits,
(d) net nonlife insurance premiums,
(e) nonlife insurance claims,
(f) current international cooperation, and
(g) miscellaneous current transfers.
These categories of current transfers are described in
paragraphs 12.21–12.58 in the context of international
accounts.

1. Personal transfers

Reference:

IMF, 2009, International Transactions in Remittances:
Guide for Compilers and Users.

12.21 Personal transfers consist of all current trans-
fers in cash or in kind made or received by resident
households to or from nonresident households. Personal
transfers thus include all current transfers between resi-
dent and nonresident individuals, independent of:

(a) the source of income of the sender (irrespec-
tive of whether the sender receives income from
labor, entrepreneurial or property income, social
benefits, and any other types of transfers; or dis-
poses assets); and
(b) the relationship between the households (irre-
spective of whether they are related or unrelated
individuals).
By convention, current transfers between house-
holds with regard to lotteries and other gambling are
included under personal transfers (discussed in para-
graph 12.26).
12.22 Workers’ remittances are current transfers
made by employees to residents of another economy.
They are included as a supplementary item.
12.23 The connection to the residence status of the
person concerned is important in determining whether
a personal transfer is involved. For example, in the
case of workers, personal transfers include only those
transfers abroad made by workers who are residents of
the economy in which they are employed. Resources
may be sent abroad by residents of an economy for
the purpose of financing other residents of the same
economy who are staying abroad (such as those sent
by parents to children who are studying in other ter-
ritories). These transactions should not be recorded as
current transfers in the balance of payments because
the parties are residents of the same economy. The
expenses abroad constitute a purchase of education
services in the case of students. Expenditures incurred
abroad by residents staying for less than one year in
foreign economic territories are generally recorded as
travel (see paragraphs 10.86–10.100).
12.24 Funds sent abroad by individuals who are
resident in the economy in which they are employed,
self-employed, or operating a business, for the purpose
of making a deposit in his or her own account with
a bank located abroad, represent a financial invest-
ment, which is recorded in the financial account,
rather than as a personal transfer. But any withdraw-
als to provide resources to a relative or another per-
son (without a quid pro quo) should be recorded as a
personal transfer. The situation of joint accounts can
arise with workers resident abroad who have joint
bank accounts with relatives in their home countries.
The treatment of such joint accounts is discussed in
paragraph 4.145. If the joint account emigrant work-
ers hold in their home country is freely usable by its
holders in the home country, the account may be con-
sidered to be held by residents in the home economy
(liability to residents). In such a case, the depos-
its made to the account by the nonresident should
be shown as funded by a transfer from abroad and
withdrawals by residents from the account would be
domestic transactions.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Lotteries and other gambling

12.25 The amounts paid for lottery tickets or placed
in bets consist of:

(a) a service charge to the unit organizing the lottery
or gambling (discussed in paragraph 10.171);
and
(b) current transfers that are payable from the gamblers
to the winners and, in some cases, to charities.
The transfers are regarded as taking place directly from
those participating in the lottery or gambling to the
winners and charities. That is, they are not recorded
as transfers to or by the unit operating the gambling.
Some of the service charge at purchasers’ prices may
include gambling taxes, which are shown as payable by
the operator, not the customers.

12.26 When nonresident households take part in
gambling there may be net transfers between residents
and nonresidents. In some cases the winner of a lottery
does not receive a lump sum immediately but a stream
of payments over future periods. This arrangement
should be recorded as the receipt of the lump sum as a
current transfer equal to the present value of the pay-
ment stream and the immediate purchase of an annuity.
The recording of annuities is described in paragraphs
A6c.29–A6c.35.

Remittances

12.27 Appendix 5 describes the concept of remit-
tances for measuring and analyzing international remit-
tances and resource flows to households and NPISHs.
Three categories of remittances are defined, which may
be included as supplementary items, as follows:

(a) Personal remittances. From the perspective of
the recipient economy, personal remittances are
defined as:
Personal transfers receivable;
+ Compensation of employees receivable;
Taxes and social contributions payable (related to
compensation of employees);
Transport and travel expenditures payable by resi-
dents employed by nonresidents (as defined under
business travel in paragraphs 10.91–10.93);
Capital transfers receivable from households.
(b) Total remittances. From the perspective of the
recipient economy, total remittances are defined as
Personal remittances receivable;
+ Social benefits receivable.
Although conceptually, total remittances include nonlife
insurance transactions (net nonlife insurance premiums
and nonlife insurance claims), these transactions are
excluded on practical grounds.
(c) Total remittances and transfers to NPISHs. From
the perspective of the recipient economy, this
category is defined as:
Total remittances receivable;
+ Current transfers receivable by NPISHs;
+ Capital transfers receivable by NPISHs.
Current and capital transfers to NPISHS are generally
recorded under miscellaneous current transfers or other
capital transfers (discussed in paragraphs 12.53 and
13.31).
2. Other current transfers
a. Current taxes on income, wealth, etc.

Reference:
2008 SNA , Chapter 8, The Redistribution of Income
Accounts; Section C, Current Taxes on Income,
Wea lt h, etc.
12.28 Current taxes on income, wealth, etc., in the
international accounts consist mainly of taxes levied on
the income earned by nonresidents from the provision of
their labor or financial assets. Taxes on capital gains aris-
ing from assets of nonresidents are also included. Taxes
on wages and salaries earned by nonresident employees
are recorded as payable by the nonresident employees.
Taxes on income and capital gains from financial assets
can be payable by individuals, corporations, nonprofit
institutions, governments, and international organiza-
tions. Taxes on interest and dividends are recorded as
payable by the recipients of the interest or dividends.
Taxes on financial transactions (such as taxes on issue,
purchase, and sale of securities) payable by nonresidents
are also current transfers. (However, if such taxes have
been classified as other taxes on products and produc-
tion in the national accounts, by convention, they may
be treated in the same way in the international accounts
for consistency.) Taxes on income and wealth may be
imposed by and payable directly to international orga-
nizations, such as the agencies of an economic union.
Taxes on rent and ownership of land are treated as
payable by the resident producers or resident notional
Chapter 12 g Secondary Income Account
institutional units; hence, they generally should not be
recorded in the balance of payments. Inheritance taxes
are treated as capital transfers (see paragraph 13.28 for
the treatment of inheritance taxes). Refunds of taxes
to taxpayers are treated as negative taxes; that is, the
amount of taxes is reduced by tax refunds.

12.29 Any other current taxes (other than taxes on
income and wealth, as explained in the preceding para-
graph, and taxes on products and production that are
recorded in the primary income account as explained
in paragraph 11.91) are also included in the secondary
income account.

12.30 Specific permission is granted by govern-
ments through issuing a license or other certificate for
which a fee is demanded. A “fee” that is a tax should be
distinguished from a “fee” that is a payment in return
for services provided by governments (see also para-
graphs 10.180–10.181 for distinction between taxes and
services). If the issue of such licenses involves little or
no work on the part of government or the fee charged is
clearly out of all proportion to the costs associated with
the issuance of licenses, it is likely that the licenses
being granted automatically on payment of the amounts
due are simply a device to raise taxes, even though the
government may provide some kind of certificate, or
authorization, in return. However, if the government
uses the issue of licenses to exercise some proper regula-
tory function—for example, checking the competence,
or qualifications, of the person concerned, checking the
efficient and safe functioning of the equipment in ques-
tion, or carrying out some other form of control that it
would otherwise not be obliged to do—the payments
made should be treated as purchases of services from
government rather than payments of taxes, unless the
payments are not broadly proportional to the costs of
providing the services.

12.31 Any fines or penalties on the late payment of
taxes are included in the amount of associated taxes.

b. Social contributions

Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 8, The Redistribution of Income
Accounts; Section D, Social Insurance Schemes
and Section E, Net Social Contributions.
12.32 Social contributions are the actual or imputed
contributions made by households to social insurance
schemes to make provision for social benefits to be paid.
Social insurance schemes include social security schemes
(which cover the entire community or large sections of

it and are imposed, controlled, and financed by gov-
ernment) and employment-related schemes (including
funded and unfunded pension schemes). Social contribu-
tions in the international accounts are recorded when a
resident makes contributions to social security and pen-
sion schemes in another economy for his or her employ-
ment in that economy, or an employer makes actual or
imputed contributions on behalf of the employee. (Social
contributions by an employer on behalf of its employees
are included in compensation of employees; see para-
graphs 11.22–11.23.) Similarly, social contributions are
recorded when a nonresident makes social contributions
to the resident social security and pension schemes.
12.33 The calculation of the amount of social contri-
butions varies for social security and pension schemes.
For social contributions to social security schemes, the
amount of social contributions recorded in the second-
ary income account includes the actual contributions
payable by the employers and employees. Because the
amount payable by employers is included in the com-
pensation of employees, the total of social contributions
payable to social security schemes is recorded as a
transfer payable by the employees.
12.34 The calculation of social contributions to pen-
sion schemes involves contribution supplements and ser-
vice charges. Contribution supplements, which represent
investment income payable on pension entitlements, are
described in paragraph A6c.41 and charges for pension
fund services are explained in paragraph 10.118. Further-
more, the treatment of social contributions is designed
to treat social insurance transactions simultaneously as
income distribution and financial transactions.
12.35 Social contributions to pension schemes are
determined as follows:
Employers’ actual contributions;
+ Employers’ imputed contributions;
+ Employees’ actual contributions;
+ Contribution supplements corresponding to invest-
ment income payable by pension schemes on pen-
sion entitlements;
Service charges payable to pension schemes.
12.36 Employers’ actual and imputed contribu-
tions are rerouted through employees (for explanation
of rerouting, see paragraph 3.16). Contribution supple-
ments represent investment income payable by pen-
sion schemes on pension entitlements. All the service
charges are treated as charges payable by the employ-
ees, because the beneficiaries are the ultimate users.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

For determining the contribution supplements and ser-
vice charges for a group or groups of policyholders,
ratios of these items to actual contributions payable
from various similar sources may have to be used.

12.37 Pension entitlements represent claims of ben-
eficiaries on the funds. The payments of social con-
tributions into the pension schemes and the receipts
of pensions by beneficiaries therefore constitute the
acquisition and disposal of financial assets. In addition,
they are recorded as current transfers in the second-
ary income account as social contributions and social
benefits, respectively, so that disposable incomes of
households reflect these flows. Negotiated changes
in pension entitlements are current transfers (if they
relate to current periods) or capital transfers (other-
wise). In contrast, changes arising from revision to
model assumptions are other changes in volume (see
paragraph 9.24).

12.38 In order to reconcile the treatment of pen-
sions as current transfers with the treatment of pen-
sion entitlements as financial assets, it is necessary to
introduce an adjustment item. This adjustment item
adds back social contributions to, and subtracts pension
receipts from, the balance on secondary income. After
the adjustment, the current account balance is the same
as what it would have been if social contributions and
pension receipts were not recorded as current transfers.
This item is called “adjustment for change in pension
entitlements” and is equal to:

the total value of the actual social contributions pay-
able into pension schemes;
+ the total value of contribution supplements pay-
able out of the property income attributed to pen-
sion fund beneficiaries;
the value of the associated service charges;
the total value of the pensions paid out as social ben-
efits by pension schemes (see paragraph 12.40).
(Changes in pension entitlements arising from capital
transfers are not included in this item.)

12.39 When cross-border flows of pension contribu-
tions and pension receipts are significant, the adjust-
ment item must be recorded in order to reconcile the
current and financial accounts. For the economy of
the employees, the adjustment item is added to the bal-
ance on secondary income (a credit entry) and for the
economy of the pension schemes, opposite adjustment
is needed; that is, the adjustment item is deducted from
the balance on secondary distribution of income (a

debit entry). When cross-border flows are minor, the
adjustment item may be omitted.
c. Social benefits
Reference:
2008 SNA , Chapter 8, The Redistribution of Income
Accounts; Section F, Social Benefits Other Than
Social Transfers in Kind.
12.40 Social benefits include benefits payable under
social security and pension schemes. They include pen-
sions and nonpension benefits regarding events or cir-
cumstances such as sickness, unemployment, housing,
and education, and may be in cash or in kind. Also
included are social benefits payable to households by
government units or NPISHs to meet the same needs as
those under social insurance schemes but that are not
made under a social insurance scheme. Cross-border
social benefits may be insignificant but can be impor-
tant in economies where a significant number of resi-
dents have or had employment in other economies.
d. Net premiums on nonlife insurance and
standardized guarantees
12.41 Net nonlife insurance premiums and net pre-
miums on standardized guarantees are described in
paragraphs 12.42 and 12.43, respectively. Net nonlife
insurance premiums are derived from total nonlife insur-
ance premiums and premium supplements after deduct-
ing the service charges. Only the net nonlife insurance
premiums constitute current transfers and are recorded
in the secondary income account. The service charges
constitute purchases of services by the policyholders and
are recorded as insurance services. Net nonlife reinsur-
ance premiums are calculated and recorded in the same
way as for the direct nonlife insurance.
12.42 Nonlife insurance premiums consist of both
the gross premiums payable by policyholders to obtain
insurance during the accounting period (premiums
earned) and the premium supplements payable out
of the investment income attributable to insurance
policyholders. The total of the nonlife insurance pre-
miums payable in this way has to cover payments
of service charges to the insurance enterprises for
arranging the insurance and payments for the insur-
ance itself. The way in which the service charges are
calculated is explained in paragraph 10.111. After
the service charges are deducted from total non-
life insurance premiums and premium supplements,
the remainder is described as net nonlife insurance
Chapter 12 g Secondary Income Account
premiums. These are the amounts available to provide
cover against various events or accidents resulting in
damage to goods or property or harm to persons as
a result of natural or human causes—fires, floods,
crashes, collisions, sinkings, theft, violence, acci-
dents, sickness, and so forth—or against financial
losses resulting from events such as sickness, unem-
ployment, and accidents.

12.43 Some units, especially government units,
may provide guarantees against creditors defaulting
in conditions that have the same characteristics as
nonlife insurance. This happens when many guar-
antees of the same sort are issued and it is possible
to make a realistic estimate of the overall level of
claims under current guarantees. In this case, the
fees payable (and the investment income earned on
the technical provisions for calls) are treated in the
same way as nonlife insurance premiums and the
calls under the guarantees are treated in the same
way as nonlife insurance claims. Therefore, net
premiums on standardized guarantees are derived
from total premiums and premium supplements after
deducting the service charges.

e. Nonlife insurance claims and calls under
standardized guarantees

12.44 Nonlife insurance claims are the amounts
payable in settlement of claims that become due during
the current accounting period. Claims become due at
the moment when the eventuality occurs that gives rise
to a valid claim. They are equal to claims paid within
the accounting period plus changes in the technical
reserves against outstanding claims. Nonlife reinsur-
ance claims are calculated and recorded in the same
way as for the direct nonlife insurance.

12.45 The nonlife insurance claim is treated as a
transfer to the claimant that accrues at the time that the
insured event occurs. Insurance claims have a mix of
current and capital elements. As a convention, cross-bor-
der nonlife insurance claims are treated as current trans-
fers, except in the cases covered in paragraph 13.24.

12.46 Claims payable under standardized guar-
antees are recorded under this item in the secondary
income account (see also paragraph 12.43).

f. Current international cooperation

12.47 Current international cooperation consists of
current transfers in cash or in kind between the govern-

ments of different countries or between governments
and international organizations. This includes:
(a) transfers between governments that are used by
the recipients to finance current expenditures,
including emergency aid after natural disasters;
they include transfers in kind in the form of food,
clothing, blankets, medicines, and so forth;
(b) annual or other regular contributions paid by
member governments to international organiza-
tions (excluding taxes payable to supranational
organizations) and regular transfers made as mat-
ter of policy by the international organizations to
governments (for the treatment of capital contri-
butions, see paragraph 13.32); and
(c) payments by governments or international orga-
nizations to cover the salaries of those technical
assistance staff who are deemed to be resident in
the economy in which they are working and who
are in an employer-employee relationship with
the host government. Also included is technical
assistance supplied in kind.
Current international cooperation does not cover trans-
fers intended for purposes of capital formation; such
transfers are recorded as capital transfers. Contribu-
tions that give rise to equity are acquisitions of shares
or other equity (as in paragraph 5.26).
12.48 External aid provided by governments
through a nonresident entity created to undertake fis-
cal functions is also considered to be current interna-
tional cooperation. These transfers are described in
paragraphs 8.24–8.26.
12.49 When goods and services acquired from mar-
ket producers are provided to governments or other enti-
ties by international organizations, other governments,
or NPISHs, without charge to the recipient, they should
be valued at market prices, that is, the prices paid by the
purchasers. When a transfer in kind involves goods and
services produced by international organizations, other
governments, or NPISHs, the valuation should be based
on cost of production, consistent with the general prin-
ciples for the valuation of services produced by general
government and NPISHs.
12.50 Generally, funding of technical assistance
has characteristics of current transfers. However, tech-
nical assistance that is tied to or part of capital projects
is classified as capital transfers because investment
grants are capital transfers. (See also paragraphs
13.25–13.26 concerning investment grants, which are
capital transfers.)
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

12.51 Loans with concessional interest rates could
be seen as providing a current transfer equal to the
difference between the actual interest and the market-
equivalent interest. If such a transfer were recognized,
it would usually be recorded as current international
cooperation, and the interest recorded would be
adjusted by the same amount. However, the means of
incorporating the impact within the SNA and inter-
national accounts have not fully evolved, although
various alternatives have been advanced. Accordingly,
until the appropriate treatment of concessional debt
is agreed, information on concessional debt could be
provided through supplementary information. The
supplementary information should show the benefits
arising from concessional debt as one-off transfers at
the point of loan origination equal to the difference
between the nominal value of the debt and its pres-
ent value using a relevant market discount rate. (See
paragraphs A2.67–A2.69 for a more detailed descrip-
tion of the calculation.) This option has the advantage
of considering all the possible sources of transfers in
debt concessionality—maturity period, grace period,
and frequency of payments, as well as the interest
rate—and is consistent with nominal valuation of
loans. Such an approach should be used for official
lending involving an intention to convey a benefit
and occurrence in a noncommercial setting (usually
government-to-government). Commercial situations
are different in that concessional interest rates may be
used to encourage the purchase of the goods and ser-
vices, and so should not be treated in the same way.

g. Miscellaneous current transfers

12.52 Miscellaneous current transfers, in cash or
in kind, include all current transfers other than those
described in the previous sections of this chapter. The
categories of miscellaneous current transfers between
residents and nonresidents are described in paragraphs
12.53–12.58.

Current transfers to NPISHs
12.53 Current transfers to NPISHs are transfers
received by resident NPISHs from nonresident insti-
tutional units in the form of membership dues, sub-
scriptions, donations, and so forth whether made on
a regular or occasional basis. Grants and donations

between NPISHs are generally classified as current
transfers (e.g., donations for relief works).
Other miscellaneous current transfers
Fines and penalties
12.54 Fines and penalties imposed on institutional
units by courts of law or other government bodies are
treated as miscellaneous current transfers. However,
early or late repayment penalties agreed as part of the
original contract are not included in current transfers;
they should be treated along with the associated good,
or service, or income, as appropriate.
Payments of compensation
12.55 Payments of compensation consist of current
transfers paid by institutional units to other institutional
units in compensation for injury to persons or damage
to property caused by the former that are not settled as
payments of nonlife insurance claims. Payments of com-
pensation could be either compulsory payments awarded
by courts of law or settlements agreed out of court. Com-
pensation may cover nonfulfillment of contracts, injuries
to persons, damages to property, or other losses that are
not covered by insurance policies. This heading covers
compensation for injuries or damage caused by other
institutional units. It also includes ex gratia payments
made by government units or NPISHs in compensation
for injuries or damages caused by natural disasters.
12.56 Major compensation payments for extensive
damages (e.g., oil spillages or side effects of pharma-
ceutical products) are treated as capital rather than cur-
rent transfers (see also paragraph 13.29).
Other
12.57 Gifts and donations of a current nature not
included elsewhere are regarded as current trans-
fers. However, payments of membership dues or sub-
scriptions to market nonprofit organizations serving
businesses, such as chambers of commerce or trade
associations, are treated as payments for services ren-
dered and are therefore not transfers. (See also para-
graphs 13.29–13.34 on other capital transfers.)
12.58 Payments to international or supranational
authorities that are regarded as being compulsory, and
for which nothing is provided in return, but which are
not taxes, are classified as miscellaneous transfers.
Chapter 12 g Secondary Income Account
Chapter 13. Capital Account
A. Concepts and Coverage
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 10, The Capital Account.

13.1 The capital account in the international
accounts shows (a) capital transfers receivable and
payable between residents and nonresidents and (b)
the acquisition and disposal of nonproduced, nonfi-
nancial assets between residents and nonresidents.

13.2 An overview of the capital account is shown in
Table 13.1. The balance on the capital account shows
the total credits less debits for capital transfers and
nonproduced, nonfinancial assets. In addition, the sum
of the current and capital account balances can also
be shown as a balancing item. The balancing item is
labeled as net lending (+)/net borrowing (–) from the
capital and current accounts. That sum is also concep-
tually equal to net lending (+)/net borrowing (–) from
the financial account, as discussed in paragraph 8.4.
Although conceptually equal, they may differ in prac-
tice. The current and capital accounts show nonfinan-
cial transactions, with the balance requiring net lending
or net borrowing, while the financial account shows
how net lending or borrowing is allocated or financed.

13.3 In economic literature, “capital account”
is often used to refer to what is called the financial
account in this Manual and in the SNA. The term “capi-
tal account” was also used in the Balance of Payments
Manual prior to the fifth edition. The use of the term
“capital account” in this Manual is designed to be con-
sistent with the SNA , which distinguishes between capi-
tal transactions and financial transactions.

13.4 The SNA capital account shows capital forma-
tion for the full range of produced and nonproduced
assets (shown in Table 5.1). The corresponding parts of
the international accounts show only transactions in non-
produced, nonfinancial assets. Transactions in produced
assets are included in the goods and services account,

which does not distinguish whether those goods or ser-
vices are destined for capital or current purposes.
13.5 The value of net lending/net borrowing in the
international accounts is conceptually the same as the
aggregate of net lending/net borrowing of the domestic
sectors in the SNA. This is because all the resident-to-
resident flows cancel out. It is also equal to the opposite
of net lending/net borrowing of the rest of the world
sector in the SNA. The relationship between saving
and net lending/net borrowing is shown in the capital
account of the SNA as:
Net lending (+)/net borrowing (–)
=Saving;
Acquisition of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets;
Disposal of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets;
Capital transfers receivable;
Capital transfers payable.
13.6 Acquisition and disposal of nonproduced, non-
financial assets are recorded at the time of change of
ownership, in line with the general principles in para-
graphs 3.41–3.59. Capital transfers are recorded when
all requirements and conditions for receiving them are
satisfied and the receiving unit has an unconditional
claim. Determining this time can be complex if there
is a wide variety of eligibility conditions that have vari-
ous legal powers. In some cases, a potential transfer
recipient has a legal claim when certain conditions are
satisfied, such as the prior incurrence of expenses for a
specific purpose, or the passage of legislation. In other
cases, the transfer recipient never has a claim on the
donor and it should be attributed to the time at which
the cash payment is made, the asset is conveyed, or
liability is canceled.
13.7 Acquisition and disposals of nonproduced,
nonfinancial assets and capital transfers receivable and
payable are recorded separately on a gross basis, rather
than netted. Gross data are important in the context
of cross-border analysis and allow the derivation of
net flows, if needed. Principles for the recording and
valuation of current and capital transfers are stated in
paragraphs 12.16–12.19.

B. Acquisitions and Disposals of
Nonproduced, Nonfinancial Assets
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 10, The Capital Account, and Chap-
ter 13, The Balance Sheet.
13.8 Nonproduced, nonfinancial assets consist of:
(a) natural resources;
(b) contracts, leases, and licenses; and
(c) marketing assets (and goodwill).

1. Natural resources

13.9 Natural resources include land, mineral rights,
forestry rights, water, fishing rights, air space, and
electromagnetic spectrum. International transactions
in land and other natural resources do not usually arise
because notional resident units are generally identi-
fied as the owners of these immovable assets. (The
identification of notional units is discussed in para-
graphs 4.34–4.40.) As a result, purchases and sales of
these assets are generally resident-to-resident trans-
actions. In contrast to a change of ownership of the
resource, the right to use a natural resource on a tem-
porary basis is classified as rent (as discussed in para-
graphs 11.85–11.90) or a contract, lease, or license, if

it amounts to an economic asset in its own right (as
discussed in paragraph 13.11).
13.10 International transactions in land arise
when there are acquisitions and disposals of land for
enclaves of international organizations and foreign
governments. (International organizations are defined
in paragraphs 4.103–4.107.) International transactions
also occur when there are voluntary changes of sover-
eignty over a particular area, whether for payment or
as a transfer. The value of any associated buildings and
equipment would be shown separately in the goods and
services account, if practical.
2. Contracts, leases, and licenses

13.11 Contracts, leases, and licenses covers those
contracts, leases, and licenses that are recognized as
economic assets. These assets are creations of society
and its legal system, and are sometimes called intan-
gible assets. Examples include marketable operating
leases, permissions to use natural resources that are
not recorded as outright ownership of those resources,
permissions to undertake certain activities (including
some government permits), and entitlements to pur-
chase a good or service on an exclusive basis. Transac-
tions in these assets are recorded in the capital account,
but holdings of these assets are not recorded in the IIP
because there is no counterpart liability. (These assets
are recorded in the national balance sheet.)
13.12 A marketable operating lease can be trans-
ferred or subleased. It may be treated as an asset only
when the lease specifies a predetermined price for the
use of an asset that differs from the price the asset
could be leased for at the current time. They could

Chapter 13 g Capital Account
cover property, time-share accommodation, equip-
ment, and other produced assets. Marketable operating
lease asset flows are recorded in the capital account
when the lessee sells the right and thus realizes the
price difference.

13.13 Some leases and licenses are not nonproduced,
nonfinancial assets and, therefore, are not covered in
the capital account. Examples include the following:

If the right to use land or another natural resource
is provided on a short-term, nontransferable basis,
then amounts payable are classified as rent (dis-
cussed in paragraphs 11.85–11.90).
If a government provides permission to undertake
an activity, unrelated to its ownership of an under-
lying asset or a service, and the permit does not
meet the definition of an economic asset, then a
tax is recorded (discussed in paragraphs 10.180–
10.181 and 12.30). An example could arise when
a government issues a restricted number of gam-
bling licenses.
If ownership of intellectual property products,
such as research and development, computer soft-
ware and databases, and entertainment, literary,
and artistic originals, is provided, then a service
is recorded. Similarly, the provision of temporary
right to use or reproduce intellectual property
products is shown as a service. In contrast, the
sale of franchises or trademarks is included under
marketing assets. (The treatment of these items is
elaborated in Table 10.4.)
A financial lease gives rise to a loan and a change
of economic ownership of the leased asset to the
lessee (discussed in paragraphs 5.56–5.60). An
operating lease for use of a produced asset gives
rise to a service (discussed in paragraphs 10.153–
10.157).
13.14 According to general principles, various
arrangements involving emissions permits can be clas-
sified in the balance of payments in different ways,
including the following:
If a nonresident enterprise purchases an emission
permit from a resident government, the payment
is classified as a cross-border tax on production
in most circumstances. However, if the payment is
part of the cost of establishing a direct investment
enterprise in the resident economy, it is rerouted as
a resident-to-resident transaction, with the payment
by the nonresident enterprise recorded as an equity
investment in its direct investment enterprise (see
paragraph 4.47). Also, if the issuing government
provides extensive services for the purchaser, the
payment is instead classified in services (see para-
graphs 10.180–10.181).
If the permit is tradable (as most are), then it is an
economic asset. A resale of this asset by a resident
to a nonresident enterprise is recorded under con-
tracts, leases, and licenses in the capital account (if
it does not involve direct investment, as described
in the previous bullet).
International expenditures associated with cleaning up
or improving the environment are recorded consistent
with general balance of payments classification prin-
ciples, usually as services (see paragraph 10.152). (See
2008 SNA , Chapter 17, for further information.)
13.15 Entitlements to future goods and services on
an exclusive basis may be an asset under contracts,
leases, and licenses. Examples include the transfer fees
paid by one sporting club to another for the transfer of
a player, and a transferable contract to acquire a good or
service at a fixed price, which may be called an option.
Very rarely, such an asset may have a negative value
(e.g., where the contract has an obligation to purchase
at one price, and the market price has fallen below that,
so the purchaser under the contract may have to pay
another party to take up the obligation).
13.16 Another example of contracts, leases, and
licenses can arise with time-share arrangements (see
paragraph 10.100(c)).
3. Marketing assets (and goodwill)
13.17 Marketing assets consist of items such as
brand names, mastheads, trademarks, logos, and
domain names. When sold separately from the entity
that owns them, they are recorded as acquisitions and
disposals of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets. (Mar-
keting assets is included with goodwill in the 2008 SNA
asset categories. However, goodwill arises separately
only in domestic accounts.)
13.18 Internet domain names are recognized as a
marketing asset in some cases. However, normal regis-
tration fees payable to a domain authority represent a
service, because the fees are in return for work done. In
contrast, where the domain name has a premium value
(i.e., in excess of the basic registration fee) because of its
scarcity, it is a kind of license included under marketing
assets. Similarly, the fee for designing a new logo is a
business service, whereas an amount to acquire an exist-
ing logo would be included under marketing assets.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

C. Capital Transfers
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 10, The Capital Account.

13.19 Capital transfers are transfers in which the
ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories)
changes from one party to another; or which obliges
one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset
(other than cash or inventories); or where a liability is
forgiven by the creditor. The definition of transfers and
the distinction between current and capital transfers are
given in paragraphs 12.12–12.15. Governments, house-
holds, and nonprofit institutions undertake transfers to
convey a benefit to another party.

13.20 Transfers from enterprises consist of compul-
sory transfers to governments or other units under court
orders, or voluntary transfers to nonprofit institutions
and other entities. Unlike governments, households, or
nonprofit institutions, commercial entities do not gener-
ally have the motivation to transfer resources to other
entities for no return, so there are only limited cases
where a commercial entity provides a capital transfer
to another commercial entity, and some cases of debt
assumption and activation of one-off guarantees (as
discussed further in paragraphs 8.42–8.45).

13.21 There may be imputed capital transfers as a
result of government use for fiscal purposes of enti-
ties resident in other economies, as discussed in para-
graphs 8.24–8.26.

1. Debt forgiveness

Reference:

IMF and others, External Debt Statistics: Guide for Com-
pilers and Users , Chapter 8, Debt Reorganization.
13.22 Debt forgiveness is the voluntary cancella-
tion of all or part of a debt obligation within a contrac-
tual agreement between a creditor and a debtor.^1 With
debt forgiveness, the contractual arrangement cancels
or forgives all or part of the principal amount outstand-
ing, including interest arrears (interest payments that
fell due in the past) and any other interest costs that
have accrued. Debt forgiveness does not arise from the

(^1) This includes forgiveness of some or all of the principal amount
of a credit-linked note arising from an event affecting the entity on
which the embedded credit derivative was written, and forgiveness
of principal that arises when a type of event contractually specified
in the debt contract occurs—for example, forgiveness in the event of
a type of catastrophe.
cancellation of future interest payments that have not
yet fallen due and have not yet accrued.
13.23 Debt forgiveness is distinguished from debt
write-off and is treated as a capital transfer transaction.
In contrast to debt write-offs, debt forgiveness arises
from an agreement between the parties to the debt and it
has the intention to convey a benefit, rather than unilat-
eral recognition by the creditor that the amount can no
longer be collected. Debt forgiveness is unlikely to arise
between commercial entities; more commonly there are
debt write-offs (as discussed in paragraphs 9.8–9.11).
(Appendix 1 on exceptional financing and Appendix 2
on debt reorganization provide additional information.)

2. Nonlife insurance claims
13.24 Nonlife insurance claims are normally clas-
sified as current transfers. For exceptionally large
claims, such as those following a catastrophe, some
part of the claims may be recorded as capital trans-
fers rather than as normal current transfers. It may
be difficult for the parties to identify these events
consistently, so, as a simplifying convention, all
cross-border nonlife insurance claims are classified
as current transfers, unless it is necessary to record
a capital transfer to be consistent with the national
accounts. To allow comparability with partner data,
a supplementary item should be provided for insur-
ance claims included in capital transfers. For current
transfers relating to insurance premiums and claims,
see paragraphs 12.41–12.46.
3. Investment grants
13.25 Investment grants consist of capital transfers
in cash or in kind made by governments or international
organizations to other institutional units to finance all
or part of the costs of their acquiring fixed assets. The
recipients may be other governments or other entities.
The recipients are obliged to use investment grants
received in cash for purposes of gross fixed capital for-
mation, and the grants are often tied to specific invest-
ment projects, such as large construction projects. Grants
for investment made by organizations other than general
government and international organizations are other
capital transfers (see paragraph 13.29). In contrast to
investment grants, a foreign government may also fund
an investment project as a direct investor (see paragraph
6.22), in which case the amount invested is classified as
equity in a direct investment enterprise. A direct invest-
ment stake is distinguished from a project funded by a
capital transfer in that the direct investor owns voting

Chapter 13 g Capital Account
power in the enterprise and has a right to future benefits,
such as dividends or the right to sell the asset.

13.26 If the investment project continues over a long
period of time, an investment grant in cash may be paid
in installments. Payments of installments continue to
be classified as capital transfers even though they may
be recorded in a succession of different accounting
periods. Investment grants in kind consist of transfers
of transport equipment, machinery, and other equip-
ment by governments to nonresident units and also the
direct provision of buildings or other structures for
nonresident units. Investment grants include transfers
of military equipment in the form of weapons or equip-
ment that are classified as fixed assets.

4. One-off guarantees and other
debt assumption

13.27 Capital transfers occur when a one-off guar-
antee is activated and the guarantor acquires no claim
on the debtor or a claim worth less than the value of the
guarantee. The treatment is the same for other cases of
debt assumption where the assumer is not a guarantor.

If the original debtor still exists, the capital transfer
is from the debt assumer to the debtor.
If the original debtor no longer exists, the capital
transfer is from the debt assumer to the creditor.
The value of any claim the debt assumer receives from
the debtor (e.g., a promise of reimbursement) is regarded
as a financial account transaction between the guaran-
tor and the debtor. The treatment of one-off guarantees
and other cases of debt assumption is described in more
detail in paragraphs 8.42–8.45, including the circum-
stance when the guarantor is in a direct investment rela-
tionship with the debtor. Different types of guarantees
are distinguished in paragraph 5.68.

5. Taxes

Reference:

IMF, Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 ,
Chapter 5, Revenue.
13.28 Capital taxes consist of taxes levied at irregu-
lar and infrequent intervals on the values of the assets
or net worth owned by institutional units or on the val-
ues of assets transferred between institutional units as
a result of legacies, gifts inter vivos, or other transfers.
They include:

(a) Capital levies. Capital levies consist of taxes on
the values of the assets or net worth owned by
institutional units levied at irregular, and very
infrequent, intervals of time; and
(b) Taxes on capital transfers. These consist of taxes
on the values of assets transferred between insti-
tutional units. They consist mainly of inheritance
taxes (death duties) and gift taxes, including
those on gifts made between living members of
the same family to avoid, or minimize, the pay-
ment of inheritance taxes. They do not include
taxes on sales of assets.
Recurrent taxes on income and wealth as well as taxes
on financial and capital transactions are classified as
current transfers (see paragraphs 12.28–12.31). Detail
on the classification of taxes can be found in Govern-
ment Finance Statistics Manual 2001.
6. Other capital transfers
13.29 Major nonrecurrent payments in compensation
for extensive damages or serious injuries not covered by
insurance policies are included in capital transfers. The
payments may be awarded by courts of law or by arbi-
tration, or settled out of court. They include payments
of compensation for damages caused by major explo-
sions, oil spillages, the side effects of pharmaceutical
products, and so forth. However, if an amount payable
under a court order or settlement is identifiable to a
specific unpaid debt, it should be recorded under the
relevant financial account item. See also paragraphs
12.55–12.56 for payments of compensation included in
current transfers.
13.30 Assets of persons changing their economic
territory of residence are other changes in volumes,
and not imputed as being a transfer, as discussed in
paragraphs 9.21–9.22.
13.31 Capital transfers include large gifts and
inheritances (legacies), including those to nonprofit
institutions. These capital transfers could be made
under wills or when the donor is still living. Capital
transfers include exceptionally large donations by
households or enterprises to nonprofit institutions
to finance gross fixed capital formation, such as
gifts to universities to cover the costs of building
new residential colleges, libraries, and laboratories.
Capital transfers also include cash grants from donor
governments or multilateral financial institutions to
the debtor economy to be used to repay debt (see
paragraph A1.7).
13.32 A capital contribution to an international
organization or nonprofit institution is a capital transfer

if it does not give rise to equity for the provider of the
contribution.

13.33 As discussed in paragraphs 3.79, 12.51, and
A2.67–A2.68, there is a transfer element with respect to
concessional lending. The transfer element of conces-
sional loans can be shown as supplementary data.

13.34 A bailout is a loosely defined term meaning
a rescue from financial distress. One action that may
occur as part of a bailout is that a government may

buy assets for more than their market value. The sale
and purchase of the asset should be recorded at the
market value and a capital transfer from the govern-
ment to the seller of the claim should be recorded for
the difference between the market price and the total
amount paid.
13.35 Household-to-household capital transfers may
be identified separately when they are significant. They
are included in the supplementary item personal remit-
tances, as discussed in Appendix 5.

Selected Issues in Balance of
Payments and International
Investment Position Analysis
A. Introduction
14.1 This chapter provides an introduction to the use
of balance of payments and international investment
position data in economic analysis. Preceding chapters
of this Manual present the concepts underlying the
components used in the international accounts. The
importance of this accounting and statistical report-
ing framework describing an economy’s international
transactions and positions derives primarily from their
impact on the domestic economy. Although the interna-
tional accounts are sometimes called the “external sec-
tor” or “rest of the world sector,” they do not constitute
a sector, in the sense of a group of institutional units
with similar motivations. Rather, international accounts
show the relationship between domestic sectors and the
rest of the world. This chapter discusses some of these
major links.

14.2 This discussion directs particular emphasis
to the factors influencing international transactions
and positions and the extent to which such factors are
sustainable. Finally, some of the implications of bal-
ance of payments adjustments for economic policy
are considered. In this chapter, it is assumed, by and
large, that international and domestic transactions
are not constrained by formal or informal admin-
istrative controls and that market participants are
free to respond to price signals and macroeconomic
policies. It also assumed that the economy does not
affect global interest rates.

14. 3 Owing to the introductory nature of this chap-
ter, the discussion of balance of payments financing
and adjustment in Sections D and E is not exhaustive,
and focuses on an illustrative case that demonstrates
fundamental mechanisms and macroeconomic inter-
actions. More complex cases with volatile and highly
mobile financial and balance sheet effects bring addi-
tional concerns and limitations. These issues are briefly
discussed in Section G, but more complete analysis

goes beyond the scope of the Manual, and the reader
is encouraged to refer to additional literature, for which
some references are provided in Section H. The chapter
does not discuss the special issues associated with a
currency union.
B. General Framework
14.4 The relationships among the economic
accounts in the SNA are described in Chapter 2,
Overview of the Framework. The major accounts can
be expressed as accounting identities. Because these
are identities, no causation should be inferred. The
SNA goods and services account shows the balance
between supply and use:
Supply = Output + M (1)
=Use = C + G + I + X + IC ,
where
M = imports of goods and services
C = household consumption
G = government consumption
I = gross capital formation^1
X = exports of goods and services
IC = intermediate consumption
Because GDP is equal to gross output less intermediate
consumption, identity (1) can be rearranged as:
GDP = C + G + I + X – M ,(2)
(^1) Often called investment in economic analysis. The SNA uses the
term “capital formation” to mean investment in nonfinancial assets
so as to make a clear distinction from investment in financial assets.
Investment is used subsequently in this chapter to mean capital for-
mation in the SNA sense. Capital formation includes fixed capital,
inventories, and valuables.

that is, the expenditure approach to GDP, where

GDP = gross domestic product.
The definition of gross national disposable income
(GNDY) is GDP plus net primary and secondary
income from abroad, so

GNDY = C + G + I + X – M + BPI + BSI ,(3)
where

BPI = balance on primary income
BSI = balance on secondary income (net current
transfers)
The current account balance is:

CAB = X – M + BPI + BSI (4)
where

CAB = current account balance
From equations (3) and (4), the current account bal-
ance can also be seen equivalently as the gap between
disposable income and expenditure:

CAB = GNDY – C – G – I .(5)
Or equivalently:

GNDY = C + G + I + CAB .(6)
As defined in the SNA use of income account:

S = GNDY – C – G ,(7)
where

S = gross saving.
Substituting identity (3) in (7),

S = I + CAB ,(8)
which can be rearranged as:

S – I = CAB .(9)
That is, the current account balance is the gap between
saving and investment.^2

14. 5 Thus, the current account balance mirrors the
saving and investment behavior of the economy. In

(^2) These relationships have been shown for the gross values of
production, income, capital formation, and saving, before deduc-
tion of consumption of fixed capital. The relationships also hold if
production, income, capital formation, and saving are expressed net
of consumption of fixed capital.
analyzing changes in the current account balance of
an economy, it is therefore important to understand
the manner in which these changes reflect movements
in saving and investment. For example, an increase
in investment relative to saving will have the same
impact on the current account—at least in the short
run—as a decline in saving relative to investment.
However, the longer-run implications for the exter-
nal position of the economy may be quite different.
More generally, identity (9) shows that any change in
an economy’s current account balance (e.g., a larger
surplus or smaller deficit) is necessarily equivalent to
an increase in saving relative to investment. This rela-
tionship highlights the importance of ascertaining the
extent to which any policy measures designed to alter
the current account balance directly (e.g., changes in
tariffs, quotas, and exchange rates) will affect saving
and investment behavior.
14.6 This link between domestic transactions and
transactions with the rest of the world is shown in iden-
tity (5). The implication of this relationship for balance
of payments analysis is that improvement in an econo-
my’s current account requires a reduction in expendi-
ture relative to income. Alternatively, it may be possible
to achieve an improvement in the current account bal-
ance by means of an increase in national income that
is not matched by a commensurate rise in consumption
or domestic investment. Implementation of structural
measures that increase the efficiency of the economy
would be one way to achieve this objective.
14.7 This last point highlights an important aspect
of the identities shown previously; these are identities
that define relationships among variables rather than
describe the behavior of economic agents. By them-
selves, the identities cannot provide a full analysis of
the factors determining developments in the current
account. For example, total expenditure on goods and
services by domestic residents ( C + G + I ) is likely to
be influenced in part by their income ( GNDY ). Thus
it would be inappropriate to use identity (5) to ana-
lyze the impact of a change in GNDY on the current
account balance without taking full account of the
induced response in consumption and capital forma-
tion of such a change. This example illustrates the
necessity for understanding the spending propensities
of residents of the economy when analyzing the bal-
ance of payments.
14.8 The interrelationship of the current account
balance with saving and investment can be seen in
greater detail by distinguishing between the private
and government sectors. Private saving and investment
Chapter 14 g Selected Issues

( Sp and Ip ) and government saving and investment
( Sg and Ig )^3 are identified as:

S – I = Sp + Sg – Ip – Ig. (10)
Use of the saving-investment gap identity for the cur-
rent account in identity (9) then gives:

CAB = ( Sp – Ip ) + ( Sg – Ig ). (11)
This identity shows that, if government sector dissav-
ing is not offset by net saving on the part of the private
sector, the current account will be in deficit. More spe-
cifically, the identity shows that the budgetary balance
of the government ( Sg – Ig ) may be an important factor
influencing the current account balance. In particular, a
sustained current account deficit may reflect persistent
government spending in excess of receipts, and such
excess spending suggests that fiscal tightening is the
appropriate policy action.

14.9 To reiterate an important point, however, iden-
tity (11) cannot be used by itself to analyze develop-
ments in the balance of payments in terms of investment
and saving on the part of the private and government
sectors because there are links between the variables
on the right-hand side of identity (11). For example, an
increase in taxes could be considered the appropriate
policy measure both to raise government saving (or
reduce dissaving) and to contribute to an improvement
in an economy’s current account balance. In analyz-
ing the impact of higher taxes, it is necessary to take
account of the behavioral response of private saving and
private investment. Private investment could be posi-
tively or negatively affected by higher taxes. The effect
would depend, in part, on whether the taxes were levied
on consumption, an action that would release domes-
tic resources and thereby tend to “crowd in” domestic
investment, or on returns to investment. In addition,
private saving would tend to fall because of the decline
in disposable income caused by taxes on consumption.
Similarly, an increase in interest rates could tend to
reduce private consumption and investment, but also
tend to put upward pressure on the exchange rate with
consequent effects on exports, imports, and differing
effects on debt service for domestic currency and for-
eign currency liabilities.

14.10 Thus, identity (11) provides only a starting
point for an analysis of the interaction between saving

(^3) The scope of the “government sector” could be defined as gen-
eral government or the public sector (definitions of both are given in
Chapter 4), according to analytical needs; the private sector would
be defined in a complementary way.
and investment decisions and the balance of payments;
the identity must be supplemented by specific infor-
mation about the factors that determine the behavior
of both the private sector and the government before
the effect of policy measures on an economy’s current
account can be ascertained.
14.11 As noted in Box 2.1, the basic principle of
double-entry bookkeeping used in constructing the bal-
ance of payments implies that the sum of all interna-
tional transactions—current, capital, and financial—is
in principle equal to zero.^4 Accordingly, the financial
account shows how the sum of the current account
and capital account balances is financed. For example,
imports of goods may be financed by nonresident sup-
pliers so that an increase in imports can be matched by
a financial inflow. At the expiration of the financing
period, the payment to the nonresident supplier will
involve either a drawdown of foreign assets (e.g., for-
eign deposits held by domestic banks) or the replace-
ment of the liability to the nonresident supplier by
another liability to nonresidents. There are also close
connections between many financial account transac-
tions. For example, the proceeds from the sale of bonds
in foreign financial markets (a financial inflow) may
be invested temporarily in short-term assets abroad (a
financial outflow).
14.12 This balance between financial and other
entries can be expressed as:
NLB = CAB + KAB = NFA ,(12)
where
NLB = net lending/net borrowing
KAB = the capital account balance
NFA = net financial account entries
In words, this identity shows that net lending/net bor-
rowing (from the sum of the current account balance
and capital account balance) is conceptually equal to
net lending/net borrowing from the financial account.
Alternatively, it could be said that the current account
balance is equal to the sum of balances on the capital
and financial accounts (with signs reversed, if neces-
sary, depending on the presentation used)^5 including
reserve assets.
(^4) In practice, they may not balance owing to errors or omissions.
(^5) Net financial account transactions could be presented as in net
lending (+)/net borrowing (–) in Tables 2.1 and 8.1 and following
from the heading-based presentation in paragraph 3.31. Alterna-
tively, they could be presented with a sign-based presentation (nega-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

CAB = NKF + RT ,(13)
where

NKF = net capital and financial account transactions
excluding reserve assets
RT = net reserve asset transactions
14.13 Thus the net provision of resources to or from
the rest of the world, as measured by the current and
capital account balances, must—by definition—be
matched by a change in net claims on the rest of the
world. For example, a surplus on the current and capital
accounts is reflected in an increase in net claims, which
may be in the form of acquisition of reserve assets on
the part of the monetary authorities or other official or
private claims on nonresidents. Alternatively, a deficit
on the current and capital accounts implies that the
net acquisition of resources from the rest of the world
must be paid for by either liquidating foreign assets or
increasing liabilities to nonresidents.

C. Alternative Presentations of Balance of Payments Data
14.14 The different presentations discussed below
can be used to highlight different aspects of balance
of payments financing and its effect on the economy.
These presentations involve reorganization of the items
to emphasize particular aspects.

1. Standard presentation

14.15 The tables presented in Chapters 2 and 7–13
use a standard presentation that groups economic pro-
cesses and phenomena, consistent with the SNA and
other macroeconomic statistics. It features two major
lines for balances:

(a) between current account entries and accumula-
tion entries—the balancing item is the current
account balance, and
(b) between financial and nonfinancial entries—the
balancing item is net lending/net borrowing.
In addition, there are a range of other balancing items
shown in Table 2.1 and Chapters 7–13 that highlight
different components.

tive signs for increases in assets, etc.), in which case the signs would
need to be reversed.

2. “Analytic” presentation
14.16 The analytic presentation is a reorganization
of the standard presentation of balance of payments
statistics to facilitate a basic distinction between (a)
reserves and closely related items and (b) other trans-
actions. The analytic presentation is an example of a
satellite account and is designed to focus on manage-
ment of reserves and closely related items, but the
term “analytic” should not be taken to suggest that
this presentation is suitable for all analytical purposes
or that other presentations are not useful for other
kinds of analysis. Table 14.1 illustrates this presenta-
tion. It draws the line between the ways monetary
authorities finance transactions (below the line) and
other items (above the line).
14.17 This presentation shows how reserves, along
with the related items of IMF credit and loans, and
exceptional financing (such as accumulation of arrears,
debt forgiveness, intergovernmental grants, and debt
restructuring) are used to finance other “autonomous”
international transactions. Exceptional financing is dis-
cussed in detail in Appendix 1. The presentation is
useful for monetary authorities that use intervention,
including managed exchange rate regimes, with vari-
ous degrees of flexibility. Arrears related to exceptional
financing are recorded below the line as transactions
in the analytical presentation with the corresponding
entry in the relevant instrument. (This treatment is
because, although the accumulation of arrears is not a
transaction, it results from the actions of the monetary
authorities.) Categories of the balance of the payments
above-the-line from which transactions could be taken
to below-the-line are marked as “(n.i.e.).”
3. Sectoral analysis
14.18 Another analytical presentation groups
items in the financial account by the type of resi-
dent recipient of external financing—for example,
central bank, deposit-taking corporations except the
central bank, general government. To support this
approach, sectoral splits are required for most finan-
cial account items.
14.19 Sectoral presentations provide a convenient
way to analyze the net foreign lending or borrowing of
each domestic sector. These data help identify issues
of sustainability and vulnerability. Sectoral analysis
is developed in conjunction with the balance sheets
(see paragraphs 14.57–14.66) and in the presentation
of external debt statistics (see External Debt Statistics:
Guide for Compilers and Users ).

Paper No. 96 (September 2008).^6

14.20 The monetary presentation explicitly shows the
link between the balance of payments and monetary and
financial statistics (as mentioned in paragraph 2.8). It
identifies the transactions of the deposit-taking corpora-
tions (plus money market funds, if their liabilities are
included in the definition of broad money), which are
equal to the foreign assets and liabilities of the same enti-
ties, as recorded in monetary and financial statistics.

14.21 This presentation highlights the effects of
international transactions on monetary developments.
This may be summarized by the following equations:

(a) The transactions derived from the balance sheet
of deposit-taking corporations (and money mar-
ket funds, where relevant) can be expressed as
follows:
(^6) Available at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/scpops/ecbocp96.pdf.
NFA + $ DC – $ M + OTR = 0, (14)
where
NFA = transactions in foreign assets and liabilities
of the deposit-taking corporations
DC =domestic credit
M = broad money (liabilities)
OTR = other (net) transactions vis-à-vis residents
$ = transactions derived from corresponding
positions (i.e., excluding any changes due to
revaluation or other changes in volume)
(b) The identification of transactions by deposit-by deposit-
taking corporations in the balance of paymentsin the balance of payments
leads to the following equation:
NFA + ETN = 0, (15)
where
ETN = nonfinancial balance of payments transac-
tions and transactions in foreign assets and
liabilities by sectors other than deposit-
taking corporations^7
(^7) Under this type of analysis, if deposit-taking corporations trans-
act in foreign assets with other resident sectors, for the identities to

international transactions on domestic liquidity. It
emphasizes the links between balance of payments and
monetary statistics.

5. Partner analysis

14.23 Data by partner economy can assist in the
conduct of international trade negotiations. They are
also useful in identifying potential vulnerability from
excessive reliance on another economy, and in fore-
casting and analyzing contagion effects. They can
be used to monitor data quality, through the study of
comparison of bilateral data as reported by each of the
partner economies (see, for example, Eurostat’s study
of asymmetries in EU current account data, cited at
the end of this chapter). Such analysis reflects devel-
opments such as the need to monitor large payments
imbalances between and among certain individual
economies and groups of economies, and the analyti-
cal interest in the source of balance of payments flows
and positions for economies.

14.24 For analysis of IIP by partner, assets are
shown according to the residence of the debtor
(or issuers of nondebt instruments), and liabilities
according to the residence of the creditor (or hold-
ers of nondebt instruments). For analysis of balance
of payments transactions by partner, data both on
a debtor-creditor and a transactor basis may be of
interest.^8 The debtor-creditor basis facilitates anal-
yses concerned with such issues as whose securi-
ties are being purchased and sold. The transactor
basis allows for analysis of where residents engage
in financial asset transactions with nonresidents,
changes in relative importance and growth of inter-
national financial centers, and so forth.

hold, transactions in both NFA and ETN need to be recorded, even
those that are resident-to-resident, and therefore not balance of pay-
ments, transactions. As noted in paragraph 3.8, in practice balance
of payments transactions in financial assets may be derived from
data that do not distinguish whether the counterparty is a resident
or a nonresident.

(^8) The debtor/creditor and the transactor bases differ in the case
of secondary market transactions and are discussed in paragraph
4.154.

D. Financing a Current Account Deficit
14.25 This section examines the financing of a cur-
rent account deficit by means of net financial inflows
and changes in reserve assets, and some of the eco-
nomic policy issues involved. For such an analysis, it
would be helpful to use identity (12), and to assume that
initially S = I (i.e., that the current account is in balance
and that net capital and financial account and reserve
asset transactions are also zero). From this initial situa-
tion, it is instructive to trace the effects, on the current
account and the financial account, of an autonomous
increase in investment (capital formation), which is
generated by a rise in the productivity of capital. If this
additional investment is not matched by a correspond-
ing rise in saving, interest rates will tend to rise as long
as the monetary authorities do not “control” the rates.
The excess of investment over saving will be reflected
in a current account deficit, which may be financed by
a net financial inflow.
14.26 Whether there is spontaneous financing of
a current account deficit—that is, whether the gap
between saving and investment is met from autono-
mous flows—depends on a number of considerations.
The functional categories of the international accounts,
as well as additional breakdowns (e.g., domestic sec-
tor, partner economy, currency of denomination), can
be crucial to assess the determinants of such financ-
ing, and therefore the appropriate policy measures to
foster the most appropriate and sustainable financing
sources. In particular, direct investment is frequently
characterized by stable and long-lasting economic
links, as well as the provision of technology and man-
agement. The financial inflow may be directly related
to increased capital formation as a result of direct
investment, loans obtained from foreign banks, or
bonds issued in international financial markets. The
foreign financing can be for the purchase of imported
goods and services required for an investment project
and for the purchase of domestic inputs. Alternatively,
additional investment may be financed domestically
by means of bank loans or issues of equities and
bonds. In this case, there is no direct link between
increased domestic expenditures and foreign financ-
ing. However, the tendency for domestic interest rates
to rise (in comparison with rates abroad) because of
the increased investment will provide an incentive
for funds to flow into the economy. Whether or not
funds do so depends largely on how investors view the
economic prospects of the economy. The prevalence
of stable economic and political conditions—particu-
larly if it is not likely that the higher interest rate will
Chapter 14 g Selected Issues
be offset by a continuing depreciation of the exchange
rate of the economy—will increase the spontaneous
movement of funds into the economy.

14.27 The financial inflow associated with the
excess of investment over saving involves a reduction
in the net foreign asset position of the economy and
the reduction, in turn, will change the net investment
income flow of the economy. The key analytical issue is
whether the economy will be able to service the change
in the net foreign investment position without undertak-
ing significant modifications in economic policies or
without incurring undesirable changes in interest rates
or exchange rates. Servicing is likely to occur without
changes if the investment makes a significant contribu-
tion to the productivity of the economy. Such a contri-
bution can be manifested in two ways: first, the firm
or government enterprise undertaking the investment
must be sufficiently profitable to pay the rate of return
that will attract the funds to finance the investment;
second, the additional investment must enhance the debt-
servicing capacity of the economy. As long as funds
from abroad are invested productively, external financ-
ing for a current account deficit is likely to be forthcom-
ing for a considerable period of time. In this situation,
the finance-receiving economy’s current account deficit
manifests an efficient allocation of resources.

14.28 Alternatively, it is useful to consider a case in
which investment is unchanged but saving declines—
for example, because of an increase in government
spending not matched by a rise in tax and other rev-
enue or because of an increase in private consumption
not matched by an offsetting change in government
saving. In this situation, domestic interest rates would
also tend to rise. However, unlike the previous case, the
shift to a current account deficit is not paralleled by an
increase in productivity in the economy. Under these
conditions, there may not be a spontaneous inflow of
funds if investors view the deterioration in the current
account as reflecting inappropriate and unsustainable
government policies. For example, the decline in saving
may reflect an enlarged public sector deficit that is not
associated with increased investment. Alternatively, the
rise in absorption may be due to higher private spending
generated by an expansionary monetary policy. Under
these circumstances, investors may not wish to increase
their net claims on the economy.

14.29 In the absence of a spontaneous financial
inflow, some combination of the following will be
necessary: policy actions to attract private funds, the
use of reserve assets for balance of payments financ-
ing, and the implementation of balance of payments

adjustment measures. From identity (12), it can be
seen that, if the current account shifts into deficit,
financing must take place either by drawing down the
economy’s reserve assets or by increasing incentives
for attracting private funds. The latter can be achieved
by enhancing the domestic economic environment for
long-term investment. The adoption of monetary and
fiscal policies that support stable economic conditions
and encourage direct and other investment would tend
to induce financial inflows on a sustained basis. Funds
may also be induced to flow in from abroad—and to
provide balance of payments financing—by the rais-
ing of domestic interest rates. Such a policy may well
be appropriate if the current account deficit is caused
by aggregate demand pressures; a restrictive monetary
policy would have the effect of dampening excess
demand and providing short-term financing. However,
such financing may not be dependable from a long-
term perspective as, for example, changes in foreign
monetary conditions may make investment of liquid
assets in the domestic economy appear unattractive.
Therefore, it is necessary to look at the underlying
causes of a current account deficit.
14. 30 The appropriateness of using reserve assets to
finance a gap between domestic expenditure and income,
rather than undertaking adjustment measures to reduce
or eliminate this gap, depends on the extent to which
the gap is temporary or reversible. As an economy’s
stock of reserve assets (as well as the resources it can
borrow to supplement its reserve assets) is limited, the
use of reserve assets to finance a current account deficit
is confined within these limits. However, by mitigat-
ing the necessity for balance of payments adjustment,
official financing can perform a useful buffer function.
For example, temporary shocks, such as poor harvests
or other temporary supply disruptions, to domestic out-
put do not necessarily require comparable changes in
the domestic absorption of goods and services. Thus
the financing, through the use of reserve assets, of a
temporary excess of consumption and investment over
national income can provide a desirable smoothing
of the path of expenditures by residents. The reserve
assets can also be used to finance seasonal swings in
foreign payments and receipts. While the financing of
temporary shocks is appropriate, recourse—although
it can make the adjustment path smoother and more
gradual—to owned or borrowed reserve assets does not
obviate the necessity for adjustment if deterioration in
the current account persists.
14. 31 There are limits to the extent to which pri-
vate funds and official resources can finance a current

account deficit. The willingness of the private sector
to invest in the economy may be directly influenced
by ongoing changes in reserve assets. If the existing
stock of reserve assets is relatively low in compari-
son with the current account deficit and the monetary
authorities are expected to exhaust the economy’s
reserve assets within the investment horizon of the
investors, then the probability of a depreciation of the
exchange rate or the introduction of other policy mea-
sures adversely affecting the rate of return expected by
investors would tend to increase significantly. Under
these circumstances, any private funds from abroad
that are financing all or part of a current account
deficit could quickly switch from a net inflow to a
net outflow. As can be seen from identity (12), unless
adjustment measures are implemented to reverse both
the current account deficit and the financial account
outflow, reserve assets would be required to finance
both an excess of domestic investment over saving
and a net increase in liabilities to nonresidents. Such a
situation would probably result in a loss of confidence
in the currency, exacerbation of the financial outflow,
and a rapid exhaustion of reserve assets.

14. 32 More generally, in a world of high financial
mobility, external and domestic private sector willing-
ness to provide financing are influenced by a complex
set of expectations about future economic, political,
and other developments in the recipient economy and
in the rest of the world. Changes in these expecta-
tions may result in rapid rebalancing of the composition
of balance sheets and cause high volatility in finan-
cial flows with significant current account and other
macroeconomic implications. Section F provides more
extended discussion.
14. 33 The previously described framework for
analysis of the balance of payments is applicable, irre-
spective of the exchange rate regime adopted by an
economy. For example, if the exchange rate is pegged,
then transactions in reserve assets will be determined
by the net demand or supply of foreign exchange at
that exchange rate (i.e., from identity (13), RT = CAB

NKF ). At the other extreme, if the exchange rate
arrangement involves a pure float so that no exchange
market intervention takes place, then CAB = NKF. In
the intermediate case of a managed float, purchases
and sales of reserve assets are typically undertaken to
achieve a desired exchange rate path for the domestic
currency in terms of one or more foreign currencies.
14. 34 Financial account transactions, as included in
the NKF term in identity (13), can be analyzed in terms
of their composition. Direct investment, portfolio invest-
ment, financial derivatives, and other investment can
have different implications for the economy, in terms
of factors such as volatility, future returns, and effect
on capital formation. More detailed data on instruments
and maturity are also relevant to understanding the
nature of the financing and its future effects.
14. 35 There is another connection between the
financial account and the current account. Finan-
cial flows generate changes in foreign claims and
liabilities. In nearly all cases, these financial stocks
earn returns (interest, dividends, or reinvested earn-
ings) that appear in the current account as investment
income. The rate of these returns can differ between
assets and liabilities and between different types of
investment. This link between the accounts is partic-
ularly relevant in the case of an economy running a
current account deficit because there is an important
dynamic relationship between an existing deficit and
the future current account balance. A deficit in the
current account must be financed by some combina-
tion of an increase in liabilities to nonresidents and
a reduction in claims on nonresidents so that the net
result is a decline in net foreign assets. As a conse-
quence, there will be a reduction in net investment
income (unless rates of return adjust in an offsetting
manner), and this reduction will increase the current
account deficit. This interaction between the cur-
rent account and the financial account can lead to a
destabilizing situation in which the current account
balance progressively worsens unless changes
in economic policies or adjustments in certain vari-
ables (e.g., exchange rates) are made to arrest the
deterioration.
14. 36 In analyzing the balance of payments and,
in particular, the sustainability of any specific current
account situation, it is important to consider the deter-
minants of financial flows. These relate mainly to fac-
tors affecting the rate of return and risk on foreign and
domestic assets. Such factors include interest rates, the
profitability of direct and other investments, expected
changes in exchange rates, and tax considerations.
These factors are embodied in the expected real (i.e.,
adjusted for exchange rates and inflation) after-tax rate
of return on the stock of foreign assets held by residents
and on the stock of claims held by nonresidents. Resi-
dents and nonresidents are subject to different legal and
tax considerations, which affect the rates of return on
asset holdings. However, both are similarly affected by
economic conditions external to the countries in which
they are resident. Moreover, these external conditions
are exogenous to an individual economy.

Chapter 14 g Selected Issues
14. 37 Indeed, whereas in circumstances of low
financial mobility and mostly official financing it
could be reasonable to focus mostly on domestic
conditions, in a world of high financial mobility,
external conditions—such as changing world interest
rates—are important factors in influencing financial
flows.
14. 38 Balance of payments statistics use the accrual
principle, which reflects underlying resource flows.
However, a payments crisis is usually driven by cash
flows. It may therefore be useful to consider cash flow
dimensions when there are significant timing dif-
ferences between payments and resource flows, for
example, in the cases of accrual of interest, reinvested
earnings, and nonperforming loans.

E. Balance of Payments Adjustment in Response to a Current Account Deficit
14. 39 There are many situations in which it may
no t b e fe a sible t o r ely o n p r iva t e a n d of f ic i a l r e s o u r c e s
to finance a current account deficit on a sustained
basis. If a deficit is unsustainable, the adjustment
will necessarily happen through change in the will-
ingness of market participants to provide financing
or depletion of reserves and other financial assets,
or a combination of both. Such adjustments may be
abrupt and painful (up to the possibility of a bal-
ance of payments crisis). Therefore, policy measures
aimed at mitigating the adjustment path may need to
be considered.

14.40 For balance of payments analysis, it is there-
fore important to consider the possible introduction of
adjustment measures to achieve a viable external pay-
ments position (i.e., conditions under which a deficit
on goods, services, and income can be financed by
private and official transfers, private financial inflows,
and some recourse to reserve and other financial
assets). The subsequent discussion illustrates some
possible measures, but it is not exhaustive. It exam-
ines briefly the roles of exchange rate changes, fiscal
measures, and monetary policy in achieving balance
of payments adjustment.

14.41 In this analysis, it may be useful to rewrite
identity (9) as:

S – I = CAB
= BTG + BTS + BPI + BSI
= NKF + RT (17)
where
BTG = balance on trade in goods
BTS = balance on trade in services
BPI = balance on primary income
BSI = balance on secondary income
The magnitude of the necessary adjustment in the
balance of payments depends, to some extent, on the
nature of the components of the current account bal-
ance. For example, an economy may have been run-
ning a persistent deficit on trade in goods that was
financed, in part, by borrowing from private and offi-
cial sources. In this situation, the economy is also
likely to be running a deficit on the balance of pri-
mary income that reflects the servicing of this debt. A
deficit for goods, services, and primary income may,
however, be offset by a surplus on secondary income,
which could reflect both official and private current
transfers. If such inward transfers are expected to be
of a long-term nature and can confidently be relied
upon to finance all or part of the deficit in other com-
ponents of the current account, then the extent of the
necessary balance of payments adjustment may be
rather small.
14.42 However, even in the case of a small adjust-
ment, it is nonetheless important to be fully cognizant
of the fact that foreign debt must be repaid. Thus the
amortization schedule of the economy is an important
factor for judging the sustainability of a particular
balance of payments situation. If large amortization
payments are due in the near future and expected
financial inflows are not sufficient to cover payments
falling due, it may be necessary to undertake adjust-
ment measures beforehand to avoid more drastic mea-
sures required for dealing with a subsequent balance
of payments crisis.
14.43 In the face of an unsustainable current account
deficit in an economy with a fixed or managed exchange
rate, one adjustment measure that could be considered is
a depreciation of the exchange rate of the domestic cur-
rency.^9 Such a depreciation may be necessary to offset a
domestic price rise (relative to prices abroad) that—by
penalizing exports and encouraging imports—worsens
the balance on trade in goods. To the extent that the
depreciation raises the prices of traded goods and ser-
vices (i.e., exports and imports) in comparison with the
(^9) The application of such a depreciation may be complicated by
significant currency balance sheet mismatches, which need to be
taken into account. These mismatches are discussed in Section G.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

prices of nontraded goods and services, depreciation
will promote the substitution of domestic for imported
products and stimulate foreign demand for domestic
products. However, because the depreciation will be
accompanied by a rise in domestic prices in response to
the increase in the cost of imported goods and services
and the rise in demand for exports and domestically
produced import substitutes, the improvement in inter-
national competitiveness generated by the exchange rate
change will be partially or fully eroded. Such a devel-
opment underscores the importance of supplementing
the exchange rate adjustment with restrictive monetary
and fiscal policies to facilitate the shift in resources
signaled by the change (caused by the depreciation) in
relative prices. Thus, an expenditure-switching policy
in the form of exchange rate depreciation must gener-
ally be supported by expenditure-reducing measures;
indeed, such measures are essential if there is no excess
capacity in the economy.

14.44 The effects of such action can be seen from
identity (9), which shows that any improvement in the
current account must be matched by a corresponding
positive change in the difference between saving and
investment. An exchange rate depreciation by itself
may generate such a change in the desired direction.
In particular, if there is no change in the stance of
monetary policy, the increase in demand generated
by the depreciation will raise the demand for money.
With an unchanged money supply, the greater demand
for money will tend to increase nominal and real
domestic interest rates. As a result, interest-sensitive
expenditures will be dampened, and there could be
a positive impact on saving. However, it is unlikely
that this induced effect on the gap between saving
and investment will itself be sufficient, particularly
if the economy is at full employment, to achieve
the desired improvement in the current account.
Therefore, in all likelihood, it will be necessary to
accompany the adjustment in the exchange rate with
measures to reduce the level of domestic expendi-
ture through tighter monetary and fiscal policies that
release resources to expand output in the exporting
and import-substitution industries.

14.45 The discussion of identity (11) pointed to
fiscal deficits as one potential cause of external imbal-
ances. Changes in government spending and taxation
may therefore be necessary to achieve the required
reduction in the saving-investment gap—to the extent
that an exchange rate depreciation does not induce a
sufficient response in the difference between total sav-
ing and investment. However, it is important that fis-

cal policy measures be designed to achieve the desired
objective and not exacerbate the adjustment problem.
For example, cuts in infrastructure investment may
have the desired short-run balance of payments effect,
but such cuts could have, particularly if the spending
reductions are in such areas as transport or electricity,
a long-run adverse impact on the supply potential of
the economy and the generation and supply of energy
designed to relieve bottlenecks. Moreover, tax mea-
sures that result in very high marginal tax rates or
that are aimed particularly at investment income could
have the undesired side effect of inducing offsetting
reductions in private saving and reducing incentives
to invest in the economy. Such disincentive effects
can be avoided by implementing fiscal action aimed at
reducing or eliminating subsidies and by cutting back
on government activity that can be performed better
by the private sector.
14.46 The stance of monetary policy plays an
important role in balance of payments adjustment.
The existing external imbalance may reflect an
excess of domestic investment over saving (or what is
the same thing—an excess of domestic spending over
income) that results from an excessively expansion-
ary monetary policy. It is, first of all, important to
adjust the stance of monetary policy so that interest
rates are generally positive in real terms and provide
an incentive to savers and so that domestic economic
conditions are sufficiently stable to encourage invest-
ment. From the perspective of aggregate supply and
demand, it can be seen from identity (5) that mon-
etary policy should ensure that the level of domestic
expenditure is in line with the productive capacity
of the economy. Thus, from the point of view of bal-
ance of payments analysis, the objective of monetary
and fiscal policies is to limit domestic spending to
what is available from domestic resources and for-
eign financing.
14.47 One important aspect of monetary policy in
balance of payments adjustment is the link between
reserve asset transactions and domestic monetary con-
ditions. A decline in reserve assets may be associated
with a current account deficit or a net financial outflow
caused by an expansionary monetary policy or both.
The reserve asset decline can lead to a reduction in
the monetary base and therefore to a tightening in the
stance of monetary policy. A more restrictive mon-
etary policy tends to correct the payments imbalance
through higher interest rates that dampen domestic
demand and make domestic assets more attractive to
investors. However, this built-in adjustment mechanism
Chapter 14 g Selected Issues
can be short-circuited if the monetary authorities offset
the effect of the loss of reserve assets on the monetary
base by increasing the domestic component of the base
(e.g., through open-market purchases of securities held
by the banking system). Such offsetting action tends to
prevent domestic interest rates from rising and thereby
contributes to the persistence of the balance of pay-
ments deficit.

F. Implications of a Current Account Surplus
14.48 The foregoing discussion focuses entirely on
an economy that faces an actual or incipient balance
of payments problem in the form of a persistent cur-
rent account deficit.^10 Of course, for the world as a
whole, the current account deficits of economies in
deficit are exactly offset by the surpluses of other
economies. Although surpluses typically do not lead
to crises in the countries that run them, an analysis of
some aspects of a surplus balance of payments situa-
tion is useful as surpluses may raise important issues
associated with domestic monetary management and
vulnerabilities and the speed of adjustment toward
more balanced external accounts. As can be seen
from identity (13), a surplus in the current account is
reflected in an increase in net claims held by the pri-
vate sector or government (NKF) on nonresidents or
an increase in official reserve assets (NRT), or both.
The change in the net foreign asset position may be
due to a reduction in liabilities to nonresidents rather
than to an increase in gross claims. Such a reduction
may well be a desirable development if a previous
large buildup of liabilities has imposed a severe debt
service burden on the economy. In this case, a current
account surplus can be an appropriate step toward
achieving a viable balance of payments.

14.49 The case of an economy with no recent cur-
rent account deficits and an increase in its gross pri-
vate claims on the rest of the world reflects an excess
of aggregate saving over domestic investment. If the
government’s fiscal balance is in deficit, private sector
saving will exceed domestic investment. The allocation

(^10) In practice, owing to measurement problems, the sum of the
balances of all economies was negative in many years because of
measurement problems. For discussion of this issue, see IMF, Report
on the World Current Account Discrepancy , September 1987, and
Jean Godeaux, Report on the Measurement of International Capital
Flows , September 1992. More recent data are available in most
issues of the Annual Report of the IMF Committee on Balance of
Payments Statistics.
of part of saving to foreign assets presumably reflects
the fact that investors find the rate of return on these
assets more attractive, at the margin, than investment
opportunities in the domestic economy. The provision
of resources to the rest of the world in the form of
a buildup of net claims on nonresidents will, by and
large, result in an efficient allocation of the domestic
economy’s saving as long as the buildup of net claims
reflects the operation of market forces rather than
government policies designed directly or indirectly to
increase such claims.

14. 50 Thus, for analyzing the balance of payments
of an economy in persistent surplus, one key consid-
eration is whether government policies distort saving
and investment decisions and thereby bias an economy
toward a current account surplus. Such distortions
can take many forms. First, there are measures that
directly influence the current account. Examples are
tariffs and quotas that limit imports, restrictions on
payments abroad, and export subsidies and govern-
ment procurement policies that give preference to
domestic producers. Moreover, an exchange market
intervention policy may bias the value of the currency
downward. Finally, there may be measures that limit
foreign acquisition of domestic assets—a limitation
that would tend to bias the financial account toward
a net outflow and thereby shift the current account in
the direction of a surplus.
14. 51 These measures may, in fact, not lead to a larger
current account surplus. Policy actions aimed at particu-
lar components of the balance of payments will, over
time, lead to offsetting movements in other components
in the absence of changes in the underlying determinants
of saving and investment. In any event, if a large and per-
sistent current account surplus appears to arise from such
distortionary measures, the appropriate policy action is
the reduction and eventual removal of these distortions.
If a persistent surplus remains after such measures are
eliminated, then the accumulation of net claims on the
rest of the world would appear to manifest the saving
and investment propensities of the economy. If, in this
case, one were to identify the surplus as a problem, it
would generally be necessary to establish that private
saving or government saving was excessively high or that
domestic investment was too low. It is considerably more
difficult to arrive at such a conclusion than to identify the
previously enumerated distortions that relate directly to
international transactions.
14. 52 A current account surplus, while reflecting
entirely a response to market forces, may cause eco-
nomic difficulties for an economy. For example, an

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

economy with a “resource curse” experiences either a
natural resource discovery or a substantial improve-
ment in the terms of trade for the natural resources
sector. The expanding sector or terms of trade gains
lead to an improvement in the current account and
an appreciation of the exchange rate. This develop-
ment tends to make other sectors of the economy
contract and be less competitive internationally. If
the newly discovered resources are expected to be
depleted fairly rapidly and the gains in terms of trade
to be transitory, it may be appropriate to protect the
sectors adversely affected. One way to achieve this
objective is through exchange market intervention to
prevent or moderate the exchange rate appreciation.
The accumulation of reserve assets or special funds
tends to insulate the real economy from having to
adjust to the short-run disturbance.

14. 53 Current account surpluses may also create
other difficulties in the domestic economy, such as
difficulties in monetary management and increases in
vulnerabilities associated with large and rapid mon-
etary expansions. When a current account surplus
causes an increase in reserve assets, the economy’s
monetary aggregates expand and a credit expansion
will tend to take place. If this credit expansion is
too large and rapid, the economy may overheat (lead-
ing to inflationary pressures) or vulnerabilities in the
financial sector may emerge, particularly if there are
weaknesses in financial sector supervision. Steriliza-
tion of the buildup in reserves—that is, offsetting its
monetary impact through, typically, sales of domestic
securities—can help mitigate this effect, but not for-
ever, and often at significant cost. These costs typi-
cally arise because the domestic securities will carry a
higher interest rate than the (usually low) rate received
by the monetary authorities for their reserves. More-
over, if the currency were to appreciate in the future,
the monetary authority would experience a decline in
net worth, because the value of the reserves would fall
relative to the value of the domestic securities used for
the sterilization operations.
14. 54 A conclusion of the preceding analysis is
that, when a current account surplus is not the result
of government policy actions, it may be difficult to
establish that an economy is investing too much of its
saving abroad and whether, therefore, specific policy
changes are needed when a country is facing a cur-
rent account surplus. Some guidance may be obtained,
however, from the behavior of reserve assets. When
a current account surplus is reflected in a buildup of
foreign reserve assets rather than in a rise in net foreign

assets held by the private sector, the buildup represents
specific government policy action in the form of for-
eign exchange market intervention. Intervention, which
involves the sale of domestic currency in exchange for
foreign currency, has the tendency to keep the foreign
exchange value of the domestic currency lower than
it otherwise would be. The accumulation of reserve
assets may therefore limit the extent to which the cur-
rency appreciates and—particularly when accompanied
by sterilization—prevent the operation of the self-
correcting mechanism that would tend to reduce the
current account surplus.
14. 55 Thus, one aspect of balance of payments anal-
ysis for an economy with a persistent current account
surplus involves an appraisal of the level of reserve
assets held by monetary authorities. The accumula-
tion of such assets is excessive if the assets exceed, by
a wide margin, the amount required to finance pos-
sible future short-run deficits. In such a situation, the
economy’s resources may well be more efficiently used
if devoted to domestic consumption or capital forma-
tion rather than exports. If the private and government
sectors are unlikely to increase domestic capital forma-
tion, cessation of reserve asset accumulation would lead
to an increase in domestic absorption or to a rise in net
foreign investment by residents or both.^11 In either case,
allocation of the economy’s resources would tend to be
more efficient as the allocation would be responding to
market forces.
14. 56 As in the case of an economy exhibiting a cur-
rent account deficit, monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate
policies have an important role in the adjustment of an
economy with a current account surplus. In principle, the
surplus could be reduced through expenditure-expand-
ing policies (e.g., expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies) or through expenditure-switching policies that
would drive consumption toward foreign goods and away
from domestic goods (e.g., a currency appreciation).
Nevertheless, expansionary fiscal and monetary poli-
cies could have the unwanted implication of fueling the
credit boom, which would cause increased inflationary
pressures and possibly heighten credit-related vulner-
abilities. A currency appreciation would, on the contrary,
moderate the credit expansion by increasing consumers’

(^11) Economies that are large exporters of nonrenewable resources,
such as oil, may have limited domestic investment opportunities. In
such cases, the buildup of foreign assets can be viewed not so much
as an accumulation of reserve assets for balance of payments financ-
ing purposes but rather as a diversification of the economy’s stock
of wealth. Also, there may be a case for the accumulation of reserve
assets in the instance of an economy subject to resource curse if the
effects are expected to be transitory.
Chapter 14 g Selected Issues

purchasing power in terms of foreign goods (which would
drive demand toward the consumption of foreign goods),
and by limiting the creation of new base money (because
the monetary authority would be limiting its intervention
in the foreign exchange market). Given that the cur-
rency appreciation would also make domestic goods less
attractive abroad, a gradual appreciation process may be
needed in order to achieve a smooth adjustment of the
external accounts.

14. 57 As financial markets in many economies
have b e come i nc rea si ngly i nt eg rat e d wit h globa l ma r-
kets, foreign borrowing has helped finance higher lev-
els of investment than would be possible with saving
by residents alone and contributed to sustained peri-
ods of growth. But the opening of financial markets
has revealed that private financial flows are sensitive
to market conditions, perceived policy weaknesses,
and negative shocks. Flows of private finance have
been volatile with some economies experiencing
financial crises.
14. 58 The financial structure of economies—the
composition and size of the liabilities and assets on
the economy’s financial balance sheet—has been an
important source of vulnerability to crises. Financial
weaknesses, such as a high level of short-term debt,
can be a trigger for domestic and external investors
to reassess their willingness to finance an economy.
The composition of the IIP also helps indicate the
vulnerability of the economy to changes in external
market conditions. The implications for vulnerabil-
ity differ among different functional categories and
instruments. In the case of direct investment liabili-
ties and portfolio investment equity, the return to the
creditor depends on the performance of the issuer.
In contrast, in the case of debt liabilities other than
for direct investment, the return to the creditor is not

dependent on the performance of the debtor, so the
economy of the debtor has a greater risk exposure,
in that payments are required to be made even if the
debtor faces difficult circumstances.
14. 59 The balance sheet approach provides a sys-
tematic analytical framework for exploring how bal-
ance sheet weaknesses contribute to macrofinancial
vulnerabilities, including the origin and propaga-
tion of modern-day financial crises. It draws on the
growing body of academic work that emphasizes
the importance of balance sheets. It pays particular
attention to the balance sheets of key sectors of the
economy and explores how weaknesses in one sector
can cascade and ultimately generate a broader crisis.
It is built on the use of harmonized classifications
and definitions in different types of economic statis-
tics, so that data can be aggregated and compared.
For international accounts compilation, the balance
sheet approach requires that institutional sector
classifications and the level of detail should match
those used for monetary, financial, and government
finance statistics.

14.60 Unlike traditional analysis, which is based
on the examination of flow variables (such as cur-
rent account and fiscal balance), the balance sheet
approach focuses on the examination of stock variables
in an economy’s sectoral balance sheets. The econo-
my’s aggregate balance sheet—the external assets and
liabilities of all sectors of the economy—is vital. The
net IIP at the end of a specific period reflects not only
financial flows but also valuation changes and other
adjustments during the period, all of which affect the
current value of a country’s total claims on nonresi-
dents and total liabilities to nonresidents.
14.61 Indeed, as the financial assets and liabilities
of domestic sectors cancel each other out, a country’s
balance sheet consists of its stock of domestic nonfi-
nancial assets plus its net IIP. But the balance sheet
approach emphasizes that it is often equally important
to look inside an economy and to examine the balance
sheet of an economy’s key sectors, such as general
government, the financial sector, and the nonfinancial
corporations sector.
14.62 The sources of financial vulnerability are var-
ied: creditors may lose confidence in an economy’s
ability to earn foreign exchange to service the external
debt; in the government’s ability to service its debt; in
the banking system’s ability to meet deposit outflows;
or in corporations’ ability to repay bank loans and other
debt. An entire sector may be unable to attract new
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

financing or roll over existing short-term liabilities. It
must then either find the resources to pay off its debts
or seek a restructuring.

14.63 To support this analysis, the framework for
assessing balance sheet risks focuses on five types of
balance sheet mismatches, all of which help to deter-
mine an economy’s ability to service debt in the face
of shocks:

(a) Maturity mismatches, where a gap between lia-
bilities due in the short term and liquid assets
leaves an institutional sector unable to honor its
contractual commitments if creditors decline to
roll over debt. They also expose the sector to the
risk that interest rates will rise;
(b) Currency mismatches, where, if unhedged, a
change in the exchange rate leads to a holding
loss;
(c) Financial structure problems, where a heavy reli-
ance on debt rather than equity financing leaves
a firm or bank less able to weather revenue
shocks;
(d) Solvency problems, where assets—including the
present value of future revenue streams—are
insufficient to cover liabilities, including contin-
gent liabilities;^12 and
(e) Dependency problems. IIP by partner economy
(and also balance of payments by partner) can
help identify overreliance on another economy,
and hence potential vulnerability and contagion
concerns.
Additional items on the currency composition and
residual maturity of debt liabilities are designed to
support analysis of these issues. Analysis should also
take into account hedging strategy; for example, cur-
rency or interest rate exposure may be hedged, or
unhedged financial derivatives exposure may imply
much greater vulnerability to changes than the value
of the derivatives suggests. Maturity mismatches, cur-
rency mismatches, and a poor financial structure all
can contribute to solvency risk, but solvency risk can
also arise from simply borrowing too much or from
investing in low-yielding assets.

14.64 Composition of the IIP sheds light on the
dynamics. For example, if assets are largely denomi-

(^12) The interpretation of loan asset values is enhanced by taking
into account additional information on fair values and nonperform-
ing loans.
nated in foreign currency and liabilities are largely
denominated in domestic currency, a depreciation (an
appreciation) of the domestic currency will have posi-
tive (negative) wealth effects. Currency depreciations
(appreciations) usually have expansionary (contrac-
tionary) impact on production via the improvement
of net exports and a contractionary (expansionary)
impact on domestic consumption. The wealth effect
associated with the currency composition of foreign
assets and liabilities may dampen the impact of a
depreciation (appreciation) on domestic consumption.
On the contrary, when assets are denominated in the
domestic currency and liabilities in a foreign currency
the wealth effect associated with a currency change
will reinforce the impact of a depreciation (apprecia-
tion) on domestic consumption.
14.65 Further, debts among residents that create
internal balance sheet mismatches also generate vul-
nerability to an external balance of payments crisis.
The transmission mechanism often works through the
domestic banking system. For instance, broad con-
cerns about the government’s ability to service its
debt, whether denominated in domestic or foreign cur-
rency, will quickly destabilize confidence in the banks
holding this debt and may lead to a deposit run. Alter-
natively, a change in the exchange rate coupled with
unhedged foreign exchange exposure in the nonfinan-
cial corporations sector can undermine confidence in
the banks that have lent to that sector. The run on the
banking system can take the form of a withdrawal of
cross-border lending by nonresident creditors, or the
withdrawal of deposits by domestic residents. Indeed,
if the latter results in an increased demand for foreign
currency or other foreign assets by domestic residents,
this could lead to financial outflows, loss of reserves,
or a combination of both.
14.66 Many of the characteristics of a financial
account crisis derive from the adjustment in portfolios
that follows from an initial shock. Underlying weak-
nesses in balance sheets can linger for years without
triggering a crisis. For example, a currency mismatch
can be masked so long as continued financial inflows
support the exchange rate. Consequently, the exact tim-
ing of a crisis is difficult to predict. However, should
a shock undermine confidence, it can trigger a large
and disorderly adjustment, as the initial shock reveals
additional weaknesses and a broad range of investors,
including local residents, seek to reduce their exposure
to the economy. If these flows cannot be financed out of
reserves, the relative price of foreign and domestic assets
has to adjust.

Appendix 1. Exceptional Financing Transactions
A. Introduction
Reference:

IMF and others, External Debt Statistics: Guide for Com-
pilers and Users , Chapter 8, Debt Reorganization.
A1.1 The identification of exceptional financing
transactions is linked to an analytic construct rather
than based on precise criteria. Exceptional financ-
ing brings together financial arrangements made
by the authorities (or by other sectors fostered by
authorities) of an economy to meet balance of pay-
ments needs. These transactions can be viewed as an
alternative to the use of reserve assets, IMF credit,
and loans to deal with payments imbalances, or in
conjunction with such use. Exceptional financing is
important for IMF operations, statistics, and member
countries, as the use of IMF resources is subject to
an analytical requirement of need, which—according
to the Articles of Agreement of the IMF—is linked
to a member’s balance of payments, reserve position,
or developments concerning reserves. Exceptional
financing is presented in the “analytic” presentation
of the balance of payments, such as published in the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook, with
the relevant transactions reclassified from that shown
in the standard components. The analytic presentation
is discussed further in paragraphs 14.16–14.17.

A1.2 Determining the need helps to distinguish:
(a) the above-the-line items (i.e., those that are
deemed to be autonomous in the current, capital,
and financial accounts and are undertaken for
the sake of the transactions) and thus contrib-
ute to or result in an overall payments deficit or
surplus, and
(b) the below-the-line items (i.e., those considered
to be accommodating or financing the deficit or
surplus).
In essence, from the viewpoint of the authorities of
the reporting economy, the below-the-line transactions
reflect (a) the transactions undertaken for balance of
payments needs that finance payments required to be
made in the current recording period such as prede-
termined debt service payments by the authorities as
well as (b) other financial transactions undertaken by
the authorities that are related to balance of payments
needs (beyond those required) and impact on reserve
assets in the current recording period, such as prepay-
ments of debt, drawings on new loans, and receipt of
cash transfers. Given that transactions in reserve assets
and in IMF credit and loans are always considered
as being undertaken to meet a balance of payments
need, it is the other below-the-line transactions that
are recorded under exceptional financing. There are
no below-the-line entries under exceptional financing
arising from the provision of financing nor for transac-
tions other than those undertaken to meet balance of
payments needs.
A1.3 This appendix provides guidance on distin-
guishing transactions in the standard presentation
that are exceptional financing transactions. Such a
distinction involves a degree of judgment. Examples
include government-to-government grants provided for
debt payment linked to balance of payments needs,
and rescheduling or forgiveness of debt falling due in
the current period. Also, in cases of arrears, “transac-
tions” are recorded in exceptional financing but are
not recorded in the standard presentation. Exceptional
financing transactions are usually recorded in the
appropriate accounts of the analytic presentation as
credit entries below-the-line, with corresponding debit
entries shown above-the-line. However, for transactions
in ar rears past due from previous periods, swaps of such
debts (such as described in paragraph A1.9), or where
debt is repaid or cancelled through transfers (such as
described in paragraph A1.5), the two entries of these
transactions are recorded below-the-line.
A1.4 The transactions identified as exceptional
financing are presented below under the following
sections:

B. Transfers—such as debt forgiveness and other
intergovernmental transfers, including transfers
from international organizations;
C. Direct or other equity investment—such as debt
or equity swaps involving debt reduction;
D. Borrowing (including bond issues) for balance
of payments support by the government or cen-
tral bank, or by other sectors of the economy and
induced by the authorities, usually through some
form of exchange rate or interest subsidy;
E. Debt rescheduling or refinancing;
F. Debt prepayment and buybacks; and
G. Accumulation and repayment of arrears.
Some of these cases involve debt reorganization that
is covered in detail in Appendix 2, Debt Reorganiza-
tion and Related Transactions. Table A1.1 presents
selected exceptional financing transactions in the
analytic and standard presentation of the balance of
payments.

B. Transfers
1. Debt forgiveness

A1.5 Debt forgiveness is defined as the voluntary
cancellation of all or part of a debt obligation within
a contractual arrangement between a creditor and a
debtor ( External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers
and Users ). Debt forgiveness is recorded as a capital
transfer (see paragraph 13.23) from the creditor econ-
omy to the debtor economy, offset by a reduction in
the liability of the debtor (reduction in the asset of the
creditor) under the appropriate debt instrument in the
financial account, with any interest accruing in current
period recorded in the income account.

A1.6 In the analytic presentation, for the debtor
economy, the recording of debt forgiveness depends
on whether the debt being forgiven is due for payment
in the current reporting period, in arrears, or not yet
due (Table A1.1, rows 1–6). Forgiveness of obligations
due in the current period is recorded as transfers,
debt forgiveness (credit item) below-the-line, whereas
the reduction of the obligations (debit item) is shown
above-the-line. For forgiveness on obligations past
due from previous periods, that is, on arrears, the
two entries are recorded below-the-line in exceptional

financing,^1 that is, credit (under debt forgiveness) and
debit items (under cancellation of arrears). If the obli-
gations not yet due are forgiven, there is no entry
under exceptional financing, because these payments
were not required to be made in the current period,
and the two entries are made above the line.
2. Other intergovernmental transfers
A1.7 Other transfers included within exceptional
financing are grants in the form of cash from govern-
ments and international organizations (including the
IMF and the World Bank) to the recipient economy.
To the extent that the cash is provided for the purpose
of financing a balance of payments need in the recipi-
ent country, the grant received (credit item) will be
recorded in the analytic presentation as exceptional
financing,^2 with a corresponding debit entry under
reserve assets (Table A1.1, row 7). An example of other
intergovernmental transfers is cash grants from donor
governments or multilateral financial institutions to the
debtor economy to be used to repay debt and grants to
finance a current account need.
A1.8 Only the initial transaction associated with the
grant is relevant for exceptional financing. If the pro-
ceeds of the grant are used for scheduled debt service
payments, no exceptional financing transactions for the
debt transactions are recorded. The same applies if
the grant is directly used to make advance repayments
of debt for balance of payments needs, such as a debt
buyback. However, it should be noted that if an advance
repayment is made out of reserve assets, an exceptional
financing will be recorded for the debt transaction (see
Section C).

C. Debt-for-Equity Swap
A1.9 Exceptional financing transactions related to
equity investment involve the exchange, usually at a
discount, of debt instruments of an economy for non-
resident investors’ equity investments in the econ-
omy (see paragraphs A2.29–A2.37). Generally, such
arrangements result in the extinction (debit item) of a
(^1) These entries for arrears arise for two reasons: First, if arrears
are repaid from reserves, a credit entry under reserves is recorded
below-the-line (see Section D); not recording the “repayment of
arrears” through debt forgiveness would create an asymmetry of
approach. Second, the accumulation of arrears resulting from bal-
ance of payments difficulties is recorded as a credit item in the
period in which they arise. The repayment recorded as a debit item
ensures intertemporal consistency.
(^2) Any interest accruing from the proceeds of the grant should be
recorded by the debtor economy as a credit in the income account.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

fixed-payment liability, a debt security, or loan (usually
denominated in foreign currency), to be recorded under
the appropriate instrument, and the creation (credit
item) of an equity liability (denominated in domestic
currency) to a nonresident, to be recorded under direct
or portfolio investment as relevant. These cases include
exchanges of a bank loan, or a liability of an enterprise,
for equity, or the resident central bank redeeming the
outstanding debt owed to a nonresident, at a discount
and in local currency (credit item), with the nonresident
reinvesting the proceeds as equity in the enterprise.

A1.10 For debt exchanged directly for equity invest-
ment in the debtor economy, credit entries should be
made under direct investment–equity, if the investor
(equity holder) directly holds equity that entitles it to
10 percent or more of the voting power in the direct
investment enterprise; otherwise, the equity claim
should be recorded under portfolio investment–equity.
These transactions should be recorded at the value of
the equity acquired, with offsetting debit entries made
under the appropriate debt instrument for the reduction
in liabilities.

A1.11 For indirect debt-for-equity swaps whereby
debt is exchanged, first for a local currency claim
(deposit) that is in turn exchanged for equity liability of
the debtor, transactions in the balance of payments are
recorded for both the initial exchange—debt for deposit
at the value of the deposit—and the exchange of depos-
its for equity. In the IIP, equity liabilities (either direct
or portfolio) increase and debt liabilities decrease by
the value of the instrument extinguished.

A1.12 In the analytic presentation, only the initial
transaction associated with the debt-for-equity swap
is relevant. As with debt forgiveness, the recording of
the exchange of claims (either debt for equity, or debt
for a local currency claim) depends on whether the
debt being exchanged is due for payment in the cur-
rent reporting period, in arrears, or not yet due (Table
A1.1, rows 8–16). Swaps of obligations that fall due in
the current recording period are recorded under equity
(credit item) below-the-line under exceptional financ-
ing, with debt repayment (debit item) recorded above-
the-line. For arrears swapped, equity (credit item) and
repayment of arrears (debit item) are both recorded
below-the-line. For debt exchanged that is not yet due,
there is no recording under exceptional financing, the
two entries being made above-the-line.

A1.13 All transactions should be valued at the mar-
ket price of the new claim received. If there is a differ-
ence in the value between the old and new claims, this

is recorded as a valuation adjustment in the revaluation
account rather than as a transaction, except when non-
marketable debt owed to official creditors is involved,
in which instance any reduction in the value of the old
debt is recorded as debt forgiveness (capital transfer).
D. Borrowing for Balance of Payments Support
A1.14 In the analytic presentation, borrowing
(including bond issues) by or on behalf of the authori-
ties to meet balance of payments needs is recorded
(credit item) below-the-line under exceptional financ-
ing. Subsequent debt payments as scheduled are
recorded above-the-line (Table A1.1, rows 17–18).
However, advance repayments for balance of payments
needs financed from reserve assets are recorded as
exceptional financing (debit item), so both the reserve
and debt transactions are recorded below-the-line (see
also Section E).
A1.15 Regarding short-term borrowing for balance
of payments support, only the initial drawing of a loan
and any subsequent increases in the amount borrowed
need be recorded below-the-line. In other words, a new
borrowing is not recorded each time the same amount
borrowed under a short-term loan is “rolled-over” and
not repaid at the maturity (the debit and credit entries for
the loan in such circumstances will cancel each other;
see paragraph 3.115). If there is repayment of the bor-
rowing (even partial repayment) this amount is recorded
above-the-line (unless it is an advance repayment under
the conditions described above). If the loan is rolled over
for a number of periods, a judgment should be made as to
whether the continual renewal of the amount borrowed
represents exceptional financing in that the balance
of payments circumstances are such that the debtor is
unable to repay the loan (see paragraph A1.2, point (a)).
E. Debt Rescheduling or Refinancing
A1.16 Debt rescheduling or refinancing involves a
change in an existing debt contract and replacement by a
new debt contract, generally with extended debt service
payments. Thus, payments are recorded as paid on the
old debt and a new debt is recorded. Debt rescheduling
refers to the formal deferment of debt service payments
and the application of new and generally extended
maturities to the deferred amounts. Debt refinancing
refers to the replacement of an existing debt instrument
or instruments including any arrears, with a new debt
Appendix 1 g Exceptional Financing Transactions
instrument or instruments. If, under a rescheduling, the
government assumes the debt of banks or other sectors
of the economy, the sector classification of the debtor
will change (as described in paragraph 8.45).

A1.17 In the analytic presentation, the recording of
debt rescheduling and refinancing, as with debt for-
giveness, depends on whether the debt being resched-
uled or refinanced is due for payment in the current
reporting period, in arrears, or not yet due (Table A1.1,
rows 19–30). Rescheduling or refinancing of debt fall-
ing due in the current recording period is recorded
below-the-line as a debt transaction (credit item) under
exceptional financing, and the offsetting debit entry
is recorded above-the-line. For arrears rescheduled
or refinanced, both the arrears on the old debt (debit
item) and the rescheduling of arrears (credit item) are
recorded below-the-line. For rescheduling or refinanc-
ing of obligations not yet due, there is no recording
under exceptional financing, both entries being above-
the-line under the relevant debt instruments.

A1.18 All transactions should be valued at the mar-
ket price of the new claim received.^3 If there is a differ-
ence in the value between the old and new claim, this
is recorded as a valuation adjustment in the revaluation
account rather than as a transaction (e.g., a capital trans-
fer), except when nonmarketable debt owed to official
creditors is involved, in which instance any reduction in
the nominal value of debt is recorded as debt forgive-
ness. Where there is no established market price for the
new claim, an appropriate proxy is used (see Appendix
2, Debt Reorganization and Related Transactions).

F. Debt Prepayment and Debt Buyback
A1.19 Debt prepayments consist of a repurchase,
or early payment, of debt at conditions that are agreed
between the debtor and the creditor; that is, debt is
extinguished in return for a cash payment agreed
between the debtor and the creditor. When a discount
is involved relative to the nominal value of the debt,
prepayments are referred to as “buybacks.”

A1.20 In the analytic presentation, debt prepayment
transactions are recorded as exceptional financing only if
they are financed from reserve assets to meet balance of
payment needs of the debtor economy (Table A1.1, rows

(^3) For analytical purposes, supplementary data could be provided
on the nominal value of the debt being extinguished.
31–33). In this case, debit entries^4 are recorded below-the-
line in the appropriate instrument in exceptional financing
with offsetting credit entries in reserve assets also below-
the-line. If the prepayment was financed from external
donor funds that are placed in the debtor’s reserve assets,
the debtor economy records all transactions below-the-
line in the analytic presentation (Table A1.1, row 31). In
the IIP of the debtor economy, reserve assets increase
when donor funds are received and decline, along with
debt liabilities, when the prepayment takes place. Pre-
payments of debt using the debtor’s own financial assets
other than reserve assets are recorded above-the-line in
the appropriate accounts (Table A1.1, row 33).

G. Accumulation and Repayment of Debt Arrears
1. Accumulation of arrears—current period
A1.21 Debt arrears arise when amounts are past due
for payment and are unpaid. If the contract remains
unchanged, in the standard presentation, no transactions
will be recorded. Debt arrears (both interest accrued
and principal) remain in the outstanding amount of the
debt instrument for which payments have been missed
until the liability is extinguished (see paragraph 3.56).^5
Nonetheless, debt arrears are an arrangement recorded
in exceptional financing.
A1.22 In the analytic presentation, arrears are included
because this presentation is focused on the actions of
the monetary authorities to meet balance of payments
needs, and accumulating arrears is an action the mon-
etary authorities can take for this purpose. Arrears in the
current period resulting from balance of payments diffi-
culties—that is, arrears resulting from the inability of the
authorities to provide foreign exchange (and not from the
inability of the original debtor to provide national cur-
rency)—are recorded below-the-line as accumulation of
arrears (credit) within exceptional financing, as de facto
the creditor is financing the payments the debtor was
required to make. The contra debit entries to the arrears
are recorded in the reporting period above-the-line under
the appropriate accounts, that is, accrued interest under
the appropriate debt instrument in income in the current

(^4) The debit entry is recorded below-the-line because the repay-
ment of the debt instrument affects the level of reserve assets in the
reporting period.
(^5) If the original contract provided for a change in the characteris-
tics of a financial instrument when it goes into arrears, this change
should be recorded as a reclassification in the other change in vol-
ume of assets account.

2. Repayment of arrears

A1.23 In the standard presentation, the repayment
of debt arrears to meet a balance of payments need is

recorded as a debit entry under the appropriate debt
instrument in the financial account and a correspond-
ing credit entry under reserve assets. In the analytic
presentation, repayment of arrears (through currency
and deposits) is recorded below-the-line as a debit entry
under repayment of arrears within exceptional financ-
ing, and a credit entry under reserve assets (Table A1.1,
rows 37 and 38).

needs, and to debt concessionality when reorganization
may involve transfers to account for such concessional-
ity. Table A1.1 in Appendix 1, Exceptional Financing
Transactions, provides a summary presentation of the
recording of debt reorganization in the standard and
analytic presentations of the balance of payments.

A2.2 Debt reorganization (also referred to as debt
restructuring) is defined as arrangements involving
both the creditor and the debtor (and sometimes third
parties) that alter the terms established for servicing an
existing debt. Governments are often involved in debt
reorganization, as a debtor, creditor or guarantor, but
debt reorganization can also involve the private sector,
such as through debt exchanges.

A2.3 Debt reorganization usually involves relief for
the debtor from the original terms and conditions of debt
obligations it has entered into. This may be in response to
liquidity issues, where the debtor does not have the cash
to meet looming debt service payments, or sustainability
issues, where the debtor is unlikely to be able to meet its
debt obligations in the medium term.

A2.4 A failure by a debtor economy to honor its
debt obligations (default, unilateral moratorium, etc.)
is not debt reorganization because it does not involve
an arrangement between the creditor and the debtor.
Such failure gives rise to arrears, which are also cov-
ered in this appendix. Similarly, a creditor can reduce

the value of its debt claims on the debtor in its own
books through debt write-offs—unilateral actions that
arise, for instance, when the creditor regards a claim
as unrecoverable, perhaps because of bankruptcy of
the debtor, and so no longer carries it on its books.
Again, this is not debt reorganization as defined in
the Manual.
A2.5 The four main types of debt reorganization
are:
(a) A reduction in the amount of, or the extinguish-
ing of, a debt obligation by the creditor via a
contractual arrangement with the debtor. This is
debt forgiveness.
(b) A change in the terms and conditions of the amount
owed, which may result, or not, in a reduction
in burden in present value terms.^1 Depending
on the nature of the transaction undertaken, the
reorganization is described as debt rescheduling
or refinancing (or debt exchange).
(c) The creditor exchanges the debt claim for some-
thing of economic value, other than another
debt claim, on the same debtor. This includes
debt conversion , such as debt-for-equity swaps,
debt-for-real-estate swaps, debt-for-development
swaps, and debt-for-nature swaps,^2 and debt pre-
payment ( or debt buybacks for cash).
(d) Debt assumption and debt payments on behalf of
others when a third party is also involved.
(^1) Also called “time value of money” or “discounted cash flow,”
present value is the value today of a future payment or stream of pay-
ments discounted at some appropriate compounded interest rate.
(^2) Some agreements described as debt swaps are equivalent to debt
forgiveness from the creditor and the debtor viewpoint. At the same
time, there is a commitment from the debtor country to undertake a
number of development, environment, etc., expenses. These transac-
tions should be considered under debt forgiveness, because no value
is provided to the creditor.

A2.6 A debt reorganization package may involve
more than one of the types mentioned above; for exam-
ple, most debt reorganization packages involving debt
forgiveness also result in a rescheduling of the part of
the debt that is not forgiven or cancelled.

1. Debt forgiveness

a. Definitions

A2.7 “Debt forgiveness” is defined as the voluntary
cancellation of all or part of a debt obligation within
a contractual arrangement between a creditor and a
debtor.^3 Debt forgiveness is distinguished from debt write-
off by the agreement between the parties and the intention
to convey a benefit, rather than unilateral recognition by
the creditor that the amount is unlikely to be collected.
Debt forgiveness is unlikely to arise between commercial
entities. Debt forgiven may include all or part of the prin-
cipal outstanding, inclusive of any accrued interest arrears
(interest that fell due in the past) and any other interest
costs that have accrued. Debt forgiveness does not arise
from the cancellation of future interest payments that have
not yet fallen due and have not yet accrued.

b. Accounting for debt forgiveness

A2.8 In the balance of payments, debt forgiveness,
as noted in paragraphs A1.5–A1.6, is recorded (at the
time specified in the agreement that the debt forgive-
ness takes effect) in the standard presentation as a
capital transfer receipt of the debtor economy (transfer
payment of the creditor economy), with a repayment of
the debtor’s liability in the financial account (a receipt
in the creditor’s asset). (See Table A1.1, rows 6–11.) In
the IIP, the debtor’s liability and creditor’s asset are
reduced by the amount of debt that is forgiven. As to
the value of the debt forgiveness, market prices are the
basis of valuation for flows and stocks, except for loans
where the nominal value is used.

A2.9 In the analytic presentation, the recording,
or not, of debt forgiveness in exceptional financing
(below-the-line) depends on whether the debt is due
for payment in the current period, in arrears, or not yet
due (Table A1.1, rows 1–6). Forgiveness of obligations
due in the current period is recorded below-the-line
as a credit item under debt forgiveness, whereas the

(^3) This includes forgiveness of some or all of the principal amount
of a credit-linked note arising from an event affecting the entity on
which the embedded credit derivative was written, and forgiveness
of principal that arises when a type of event contractually specified
in the debt contract occurs, such as forgiveness in the event of a type
of catastrophe.
reduction of the obligations is shown above-the-line
as a debit item. For forgiveness in arrears from previ-
ous periods, a credit entry under debt forgiveness and
a debit entry under cancellation of arrears are both
recorded below-the-line under exceptional financing.
If the obligations not yet due are forgiven, there are
no entries under exceptional financing; all entries are
above-the-line.

2. Debt rescheduling and refinancing
A2.10 Debt rescheduling and refinancing involve a
change in an existing debt contract and replacement by
a new debt contract, generally with extended debt ser-
vice payments. Debt rescheduling involves rearrange-
ments on the same type of instrument, with the same
principal value and the same creditor as with the old
debt. Refinancing entails a different debt instrument,
generally at different value, and may be with a creditor
different than that from the old debt.^4 For instance, a
creditor may choose to apply the terms of a Paris Club
agreement either through a debt rescheduling option
(that is, changing the terms and conditions of its exist-
ing claims on the debtor) or through refinancing (mak-
ing a new loan to the debtor that is used to repay the
existing debt).

a. Debt rescheduling
Definition
A2.11 Debt rescheduling is a bilateral arrangement
between the debtor and the creditor that constitutes
a formal deferment of debt service payments and the
application of new and generally extended maturities.
The new terms normally include one or more of the fol-
lowing elements: extending repayment periods, reduc-
tions in the contracted interest rate, adding or extending
grace periods for the repayment of principal, fixing the
exchange rate at favorable levels for foreign currency
debt, and rescheduling the payment of arrears, if any. In
the specific instance of zero coupon securities, a reduc-
tion in the principal amount to be paid at redemption to
an amount that still exceeds the principal amount out-
standing at the time the arrangement becomes effective
could be classified as either an effective change in the
(^4) From the debtor perspective, debt refinancing may involve bor-
rowing from a third party to repay a creditor. The definition of
debt refinancing in the Manual is a narrower concept reflecting
transactions between the debtor and same creditor only. The trans-
actions associated with borrowing from a third party for balance
of payments support are set out in Section D, Borrowing for Bal-
ance of Payments Support, of Appendix 1, Exceptional Financing
Transactions.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

contractual rate of interest or a reduction in principal
with the contractual rate unchanged. Such a reduction
in the principal payment to be made at maturity should
be recorded as debt forgiveness, or debt rescheduling
if the bilateral agreement explicitly acknowledges a
change in the contractual rate of interest. Under Paris
Club arrangements, rescheduling can be characterized
as “flow” or “stock” rescheduling. A flow reschedul-
ing refers to a rescheduling of specified debt service
falling due during a certain period and, in some cases,
specified arrears outstanding at the beginning of that
period.^5 A stock rescheduling refers to rescheduling the
outstanding stock of debt at a particular point in time.

Accounting for debt rescheduling
A2.12 The balance of payments treatment for debt
rescheduling is that the existing contract is extin-
guished and a new contract created. The applicable
existing debt is recorded as being repaid and a new debt
instrument (or instruments) created with the new terms
and conditions. In the standard presentation for the
debtor, a debit entry is recorded under the appropriate
instrument representing the repayment of the old debt
with a credit entry under the appropriate instrument
representing the creation of a new debt (Table A1.1,
rows 19–25). This treatment does not apply, however,
to interest arrears that are being rescheduled when the
conditions in the existing debt contract remain intact.
In such a case, the existing debt contract is not consid-
ered to be rescheduled, only the interest arrears. The
IIP reflects the transactions extinguishing the old debt
instrument and creating the new instrument.

A2.13 The transaction is recorded at the time both
parties record the change in terms in their books, and
is valued at the value of the new debt (which, under
a debt rescheduling, is the same value as that of the
old debt). If no precise time is determined, the time at
which the creditor records the change in terms in its
books is decisive. If the rescheduling of obligations due
beyond the current period is linked to the fulfillment of
certain conditions by the time the obligations fall due
(such as multiyear Paris Club rescheduling), entries are
recorded in the balance of payments only in the period
when the specified conditions are met.

A2.14 In the analytic presentation, as noted in
Appendix 1, Exceptional Financing Transactions, the
recording of debt rescheduling transactions in excep-

(^5) In the balance of payments, if the debt falling due during the
period is rescheduled, the transaction is treated the same as the
rescheduling of a debt stock.
tional financing depends on whether the debt being
rescheduled is due for payment in the current period,
in arrears, or not yet due. Obligations falling due in the
reporting period are recorded under exceptional financ-
ing (below-the-line as credit entries under the appropri-
ate instruments), with debit entries made above-the-line
under the appropriate debt instruments in the financial
account and the income account (for accrued interest)
(Table A1.1, rows 19–22). For arrears, the two entries
are under exceptional financing, that is, below-the-line,
with credit items (under the relevant instrument) and
debit items (under rescheduling of arrears) (Table A1.1,
rows 23–24). For obligations not yet due, both debit
and credit entries are recorded above-the-line under the
appropriate instruments in the financial account (Table
A1.1, row 25).
b. Debt refinancing
Definition
A2.15 Debt refinancing involves the replacement of
an existing debt instrument or instruments, including
any arrears, with a new debt instrument or instru-
ments. It can involve the exchange of the same type of
debt instrument (loan for a loan) or different types of
debt instruments (loan for a bond). For instance, the
public sector may convert various export credit debts
into a single loan. Also, debt refinancing can be said
to have taken place when a debtor exchanges existing
bonds for new bonds through exchange offers given by
its creditor (rather than a change in terms and condi-
tions). So debt refinancing can occur irrespective of
whether the debtor is experiencing balance of payments
difficulties or not.
Accounting for debt refinancing
A2.16 The balance of payments treatment of debt refi-
nancing transactions is similar to debt rescheduling to the
extent that the debt being refinanced is extinguished and
replaced with a new financial instrument or instruments.
However, unlike in rescheduling, the old debt is extin-
guished at the value of the new debt instrument except for
nonmarketable debt owed to official creditors.
A2.17 If the refinancing involves direct debt
exchange, such as a loan-for-bond swap, in the standard
presentation, debit entries are recorded by the debtor
under the appropriate debt instrument in the financial
account and the income account (for accrued interest)
and a credit entry under portfolio investment liabilities
to show the creation of the new obligation (Table A1.1,
rows 26–30). The transaction is valued at the value of
Appendix 2 g Debt Reorganization and Related Transactions

the new debt with the difference between the value of
the old debt and that of the new instrument recorded in
the revaluation account. However, if the debt is owed
to official creditors and is nonmarketable (loan), the
old debt is extinguished at its original value with the
difference in value with the new instrument recorded
as debt forgiveness.

A2.18 Where there is no established market price
for the new bond, an appropriate proxy is used. For
example, if the bond is similar to other bonds being
traded, the market price of a traded bond would be an
appropriate proxy for the value of the new bond. If the
debt being swapped was recently acquired by the credi-
tor, the acquisition price would be an appropriate proxy.
Alternatively, if the interest rate on the new bond is
below the prevailing interest rate, the discounted value
of the bond, using the prevailing interest rate, could
serve as a proxy. If such information is not available,
the face value of the bond being issued may be used as
a proxy. See also debt-for-equity conversion below.

A2.19 The IIP reflects the transactions extinguish-
ing the old debt instrument and creating the new debt
instrument along with any valuation change recorded in
the revaluation account. For instance, a loan-for-bond
exchange undertaken will generally result in a reduc-
tion in the liabilities of the debtor (reduction in the
claim of the creditor on the debtor economy) because
the loan is recorded at nominal value versus the market
value of the bond.

A2.20 In the analytic presentation, debt-for-bond
exchange of obligations falling due in the reporting
period are recorded below-the-line as credit entries
under the appropriate instruments in exceptional financ-
ing, with debit entries made above-the-line under the
appropriate debt instruments in the financial account and
the income account (for accrued interest) (Table A1.1,
rows 26–27). For arrears refinanced, there are offsetting
credit (under the relevant instrument) and debit items
(under rescheduling of arrears) under exceptional financ-
ing. For obligations not yet due, both debit and credit
entries are recorded above-the-line under the appropriate
instruments in the financial account (Table A1.1, row
30). When arrears are cancelled as a result of a debt-for-
debt exchange, the two entries are below-the-line: a debit
entry under cancellation of arrears (under the relevant
debt instrument in the standard presentation) and a credit
item under debt forgiveness (Table A1.1, rows 28–29).

A2.21 If the proceeds of the new debt are used to
partially pay off existing debt, any remaining debt is
recorded as the extinguishment of the old debt and

creation of a new debt, unless it is paid off through a
separate transaction.
A2.22 If the terms of any new borrowings are con-
cessional, the creditor could be seen as providing a
transfer to the debtor. Debt concessionality is discussed
below.
3. Debt conversion and debt prepayment

a. Definitions
A2.23 Debt conversion (swap) is an exchange of
debt—typically at a discount—for a nondebt claim
such as equity, or for counterpart funds that can be
used to finance a particular project or policy. Typically
debt conversion involves an exchange of external debt
in foreign currency for a nondebt obligation in domestic
currency, at a discount. Debt for equity, debt for exports,
debt for nature, and debt for development swaps are all
examples of debt conversion. In essence, external debt
is extinguished and a nondebt liability created.
A2.24 A debt-for-equity swap results in reduced debt
liability and an increase in equity liability of the debtor
economy. A third party, usually a nongovernmental
organization (NGO) or a corporation, is often involved
in a debt-for-equity swap, buying the claims from the
foreign creditor and receiving shares in a corporation or
local currency (to be used for equity investment) from
the debtor economy.
A2.25 Other types of debt swaps, such as exter-
nal debt obligations for exports (debt for exports) or
external debt obligations for counterpart assets that are
provided by the debtor to the creditor for a specified
purpose, such as wildlife protection, health, education,
and environmental conservation (debt for sustainable
development) are also debt conversions.
A2.26 It is important to distinguish direct and indi-
rect debt conversion, that is, whether the swap leads
directly to the acquisition of a nondebt claim on the
debtor, or indirectly via another claim on the economy,
such as a deposit that is subsequently used to purchase
equity.
b. Accounting for debt conversion
A2.27 Where debt is exchanged for another item
(e.g., equity or counterpart funds for development pur-
poses), the transaction is recorded at the time both
parties record the exchange of value in their books.
The general principle is for the old debt to be valued
at the value of the item acquired (converted at the pre-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

vailing market exchange rate if the item is in foreign
currency). Any difference between the value of the
debt being extinguished and the corresponding claim
or funds provided is recorded as a valuation adjustment
in the revaluation account. An exception arises when
official creditors are owed nonmarketable debt, and
the counterpart claim (assets) has a lower value than
the debt, in which case the transaction in the old debt
is recorded at its full value and any difference in value
between the debt and counterpart item (or assets) is
recorded as debt forgiveness, a capital transfer. With
debt-for-development swaps, the transactions recorded
should be based on the type of debt obligation forgiven
rather than the subsequent use of the funds.

A2.28 Debt-for-equity and debt-for-development
swaps are the most commonly used debt conversion
arrangements.

c. Debt-for-equity swaps

Direct debt conversion
A2.29 For debt exchanged directly for equity invest-
ment in the debtor economy, credit entries should
be made under direct investment–equity, or portfo-
lio investment–equity. These transactions should be
recorded at the value of the equity acquired, with off-
setting debit entries made under the appropriate debt
instrument for the reduction in liabilities. The treatment
of transactions recorded depends on whether the debt
being swapped is due for payment in the current period,
is in arrears, or is not yet due (Table A1.1, rows 8–11).

Debt due for payment in the current period
A2.30 In the standard presentation, for a debt-for-
equity swap there are debit entries under the relevant
instrument, such as other investment liabilities, and
the income account (for accrued interest) for all pay-
ments falling due in the current period. The value of the
repayment of the old debt is equal to the market value
of the equity liability being swapped, with the contra-
entry credit recorded in direct investment–equity, or
portfolio investment–equity. If the market value of the
new liability is lower than the value of the old debt,
a valuation adjustment is recorded under the relevant
instrument, such as loan liabilities in the revaluation
account (see also paragraph A1.13).

A2.31 In the analytic presentation, the debit entries
are recorded above-the-line and the contra-entry credit
is recorded below-the-line under direct investment or
portfolio investment-equity.

Debt in arrears
A2.32 In the standard presentation, debt-for-equity
swaps for arrears are recorded as a debit entry under
the relevant instrument in the financial account, at
the value of the equity liabilities being provided, with
the contra-entry credit in direct investment–equity or
portfolio investment–equity. In the analytic presenta-
tion, a debit entry is recorded in exceptional financ-
ing under cancellation of arrears, with the offsetting
credit entry also recorded in exceptional financing
under direct investment-equity or portfolio investment-
equity.
Debt due for payment in the future
A2.33 In the standard presentation, debit entries
arising from debt-for-equity swap operations for debt
due for payment in the future and exchanged at a price
below nominal value are recorded as a debit entry in the
respective accounts at the value of the equity liabilities
being provided with the contra-entry credit in direct
investment-equity, if the direct investor (equity holder)
directly holds equity that entitles it to 10 percent or
more of the voting power in the direct investment enter-
prise; otherwise, the equity claim should be recorded
under portfolio investment-equity. If the market value
of the new liability is lower than the value of the old
debt, a valuation adjustment is recorded under the rel-
evant instrument, such as loan liabilities in the revalua-
tion account (see also paragraph A1.13). In the analytic
presentation, all entries are made above-the-line as in
the standard presentation.
A2.34 In all cases, in the IIP, equity liabilities
(either direct or portfolio) increase and debt liabilities
decrease by the value of the instrument extinguished.
Indirect debt conversion
A2.35 A debt-for-equity swap may also involve
indirect conversion. An example is when a fixed-pay-
ment foreign currency liability (e.g., a debt security or
loan) is exchanged at a discount for a domestic financial
instrument, such as a domestic currency deposit. The
proceeds are then reinvested by the nonresident into the
equity of the debtor. These swaps are valued at market
prices in the balance of payments.
A2.36 In the standard presentation, this transaction
is recorded by the debtor as an increase in liabilities
(credit) under the financial instrument provided, with
corresponding debit entries under the instrument (lia-
bility) being extinguished (Table A1.1, rows 12–16).
Subsequently, the nonresident creditor exchanges the
Appendix 2 g Debt Reorganization and Related Transactions
financial instrument received for equity investment
in an enterprise of the debtor economy. At this point,
a credit entry is recorded under direct investment–
equity, if the direct investor (equity holder) directly
holds equity that entitles it to 10 percent or more of
the voting power in the direct investment enterprise;
otherwise, the equity claim should be recorded under
portfolio investment–equity. The offsetting debit
entry is made under the relevant instrument being
exchanged for the equity, such as currency and depos-
its. In the IIP, equity liabilities (either direct or portfo-
lio) increase and debt liabilities decrease by the value
of the instrument extinguished.

A2.37 In the analytic presentation, the treatment is
the same as described for direct debt conversion except
that only the initial transaction is relevant, so the credit
entry is recorded under the relevant financial instru-
ment provided, rather than equity.

d. Debt-for-development swaps

A2.38 A debt-for-development swap involves the
exchange at a discount of an existing liability (e.g., a
debt security or loan) for a claim (such as a domestic
deposit) earmarked for a specific development purpose
in the debtor economy. For example, an NGO purchases
debt from the original creditor at a substantial dis-
count using its own foreign currency resources, and
then resells it to the debtor country government for
local currency equivalent. The NGO in turn spends the
money on a development project, previously agreed on
with the debtor country government.

A2.39 In the standard presentation, the debtor
economy records the transaction only with the
creditor (such as an NGO). The debtor records an
increase in liabilities (credit) under the appropriate
debt instrument provided to the creditor, with an
offsetting debit entry recorded under the appropriate
debt instrument being extinguished (Table A1.1, rows
39–43). In the IIP, liabilities decline by the value of
the debt extinguished and increase by the value of
the other claim provided that it is still outstanding at
the end of the period.

A2.40 If a debt-for-development swap is under-
taken to meet a balance of payments need, only the
initial transaction with the creditor is relevant for the
analytic presentation. Subsequent use by the creditor
of the assets acquired for development in the debtor
economy is not exceptional financing—the credit
items are recorded as capital transfers (Table A1.1,
row 43).

e. Debt prepayment
Definitions
A2.41 Debt prepayments consist of a repurchase,
or early payment, of debt at conditions that are agreed
between the debtor and the creditor; that is, debt is
extinguished in return for a cash payment agreed
between the debtor and the creditor. When a discount
is involved relative to the nominal value of the debt,
prepayments are referred to as “buybacks.” Debt pre-
payment could be driven by the debtor’s need to reduce
the cost of its debt portfolio by taking advantage of
favorable economic performance or market conditions
to repurchase debt, or for balance of payments purposes,
such as a looming balance of payments constraint.
Accounting for debt prepayment
A2.42 In the standard presentation, debit entries
relating to debt prepayment are recorded by the debtor
in the appropriate instrument in the financial account
when the transactions take place at the value of the
debt prepaid. Credit entries are recorded in reserve
assets or in currency and deposits in other invest-
ment– assets depending on the source of financing. In
the IIP, the debtor’s liability declines by the amount
of debt prepaid. As noted in Appendix 1, Exceptional
Financing Transactions, if prepayment of debt is
linked to balance of payments needs and is financed
from reserve assets, both credit and debit items are
recorded below-the-line in exceptional financing and
reserve assets, respectively (Table A1.1, rows 31–32).
Prepayments of debt using debtor’s own financial
assets other than reserve assets is recorded above-the-
line as in standard presentation (Table A1.1, row 33).
If the debt is owed to official creditors and is non-
marketable (loan), some element of debt forgiveness
could arise—that is, if the prepayment occurs within
an agreement between the parties with an intention to
convey a benefit (see paragraph A2.7).
A2.43 In the analytic presentation, debt prepayment
transactions are recorded as exceptional financing only
if they are financed from reserve assets for the balance
of payments purposes of the debtor economy. In this
case, debit entries are recorded below-the-line in the
appropriate instrument in exceptional financing with
offsetting credit entries in reserves recorded below-
the-line.
A2.44 If the prepayment was financed from exter-
nal donor funds, transactions could result in a two-stage
analysis if cash is provided to the debtor economy that
subsequently uses the proceeds to prepay the debt.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Stage 1
A2.45 The debtor economy records in the standard
presentation a credit entry under capital transfers in the
capital account equal to the donor funds provided. An
offsetting debit entry is recorded in reserves assets. In
the analytic presentation, the debtor economy records
a credit entry below-the-line under transfers in excep-
tional financing, with the offsetting debit entry recorded
in reserve assets.

Stage 2
A2.46 When the debt prepayment occurs, the
debtor economy records in the standard presentation
the repayment of the debt instrument as a debit entry
at the value paid, with an offsetting credit entry in
reserve assets. In the analytic presentation, the debit
entry is recorded under the relevant debt instrument
below-the-line^6 and the credit entry under reserve
assets. Savings arise in future years as a result of the
prepayment of the debt. The debit entry is recorded
below-the-line as the transaction affects reserve assets
in the reporting period.

A2.47 In the IIP of the debtor economy, assets
increase in the first stage and decline, along with debt
liabilities, when the prepayment takes place.

4. Debt assumption and debt payments on
behalf of others

a. Debt assumption

Definition
A2.48 Debt assumption is a trilateral agreement
between a creditor, a former debtor, and a new debtor
under which the new debtor assumes the former debt-
or’s outstanding liability to the creditor and is liable for
repayment of debt. Calling a guarantee is an example
of debt assumption. If the original debtor defaults on its
debt obligations, the creditor may invoke the contract
conditions permitting the guarantee from the guaran-
tor to be called. The guarantor unit then must either
repay the debt or assume responsibility for the debt
as the primary debtor and the liability of the original
debtor is extinguished. Governments can be the debtor
that is defaulting or the guarantor. Also, a government
through agreement can offer to provide funds to pay
off the debt obligation of another government owed to
a third party.

(^6) Advance payments for balance of payments need are recorded
below-the-line (see Appendix 1, Exceptional Financing Transactions).
Accounting for debt assumption
A2.49 The amount of the debt to be recorded is the
full amount of the outstanding debt unless there is an
agreement with the creditor to reduce the amount of debt
owed. The timing of the recording is at the time the debt
is removed from the original debtor’s balance sheet.
A2.50 In the standard presentation the transac-
tion recorded between the creditor and debtor is as
described in paragraphs 8.42–8.45 and Box 8.1. The
creditor records a new loan claim on the new debtor.
The extinguishing of the original debt is classified as a
transaction if the original debtor continues to exist, or
as other volume change (with a capital transfer recorded
from the new debtor to the creditor) if the original
debtor no longer exists.
A2.51 In many cases it is likely that the entity
assuming the debt and the original debtor are resident
in the same economy, such as the case of a government
assuming the debt of a resident entity. In such instances,
the sector classification of the debtor may change.
A2.52 However, if the assuming entity was in
a different economy from the original debtor was,
then the nature of the transactions recorded would
depend on whether the assuming economy obtained
a claim on the original debtor and, if not, the rela-
tionship between the two entities. The terms of the
debt assumption may include a legal obligation for the
defaulting entity to pay back to the guaranteeing unit
the amount of debt assumed. If so, in the standard pre-
sentation, the original debtor economy would record
both credit and debit entries under the relevant debt
instrument(s) in the financial account. If no claim was
established, then a capital transfer (debt forgiveness)
would be recorded from the assuming to the original
debtor economy. However, if the original debtor was
in a direct investment relationship with the entity in
the assuming economy, in which instance an increase
in the direct investor’s equity (or decrease if the parent
is the original debtor) would be recorded in the direct
investment enterprise. If the new debtor acquires a
claim that only partially covers the debt acquired, the
difference is classified as debt forgiveness by both the
original and new debtors. If the original debtor no
longer exists, an other volume change is recorded, as
described in paragraph A2.50.
A2.53 In the analytic presentation, if the new
debtor and original debtor are resident in differ-
ent economies, the recording of debt assumption is
the same as for debt rescheduling if the new debtor
acquires a claim on the original debtor. If not, then
Appendix 2 g Debt Reorganization and Related Transactions

the recording of the debt assumption is the same
as for debt forgiveness (except in the case of direct
investment as described in the previous paragraph).
When a partial claim is acquired, the recording as
between debt rescheduling and debt forgiveness is
prorated accordingly.

b. Debt payments on behalf of others

Definition
A2.54 Rather than assume the debt, a government
may decide to repay a specific borrowing or make a
specific payment on behalf of another institutional
unit, without the guarantee being called or the debt
being taken over. In this case, the debt stays recorded
solely in the balance sheet of the other institutional
unit, the only legal debtor. As the existing debt
remains extant, and the terms remain unaltered, this
is not considered debt reorganization. Such a situation
may occur where the debtor is experiencing temporary
financial difficulties rather than permanent financial
problems.

Accounting for debt payments on behalf of others
A2.55 As with debt assumption, the recording of
transactions depends on whether the two entities are
located in the same economy or not, and whether or
not the payer receives a financial claim on the debtor
in respect of the debt service payments it has made on
behalf of the debtor.

A2.56 If the paying entity and the original debtor are
resident in the same economy, then no balance of pay-
ments transactions are reported between them. If they
are in different economies, and a claim is established
on the original debtor, the paying economy records an
increase in financial assets and a decrease in reserve
assets or currency and deposits, depending on the
source of funding. Otherwise, as with debt assumption,
a capital transfer or direct investment–equity transac-
tion is recorded. The payment of the debt service is not
recorded as a payment of interest or principal by the
paying economy because the payments are not related
to a liability in its balance sheet.

A2.57 If a financial claim has not been established,
and the transactions arise from a balance of payments
need, in the analytic presentation the debtor country
records a credit entry below-the-line in transfers (other
intergovernmental grants) under exceptional financing
and a debit entry above-the-line reflecting any interest
and principal payments made.

5. Special cases
a. Debt service falling due between Paris
Club agreed minute date and specified
implementation date^7
A2.58 Under Paris Club debt rescheduling arrange-
ments, creditor countries as a group usually agree in
the nonbinding “Agreed Minute” that they sign, that
payment terms and conditions of applicable debt fall-
ing due before the specified effective (implementation)
date of the Paris Club bilateral agreement might not be
paid on schedule. However, interest continues to accrue
based on the existing loan terms, but payments are not
made, up until the point when there is a formal bilateral
agreement.
A2.59 W h e n s u c h p ay m e n t s fa l l d u e , t h ey a r e c o n s id -
ered technical arrears ( External Debt Statistics: Guide
for Compilers and Users , paragraph 3.37). Given that
there is a mutually signed understanding between the
debtor and the creditor that the terms and conditions in
the mother agreement are temporarily suspended, tech-
nical arrears are treated in the standard presentation
of the debtor economy as rescheduled short-term debt
and classified under other investment, other accounts
receivable/payable, until the effective date of the bilat-
eral agreement when the new terms apply.^8 When the
new terms apply, there may be a need to reclassify
technical arrears to the appropriate instruments in the
financial account.
A2.60 In the analytic presentation, debit entries are
recorded above-the-line as in the standard presenta-
tion, while corresponding credit entries are recorded
below-the-line as accumulation of arrears, in excep-
tional financing.

b. Debt service moratorium extended by
creditors
A2.61 Debt service moratorium involves an indi-
vidual creditor permitting the debtor a formal suspen-
sion of debt service payments falling due within a given
period. Debt service moratorium may be granted in
the event of natural disasters, such as the moratorium
granted to tsunami-affected countries in 2005, and usu-
ally involves formal exchange of letters but not neces-
sarily a formal bilateral agreement.
(^7) The guidance in this section is based on the Paris Club arrange-
ments because the issue described most commonly arises in that
forum. But the guidance is equally applicable to other fora in which
the same issue arises.
(^8) This approach is applicable to other debt rescheduling arrange-
ments with similar terms.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

A2.62 As the intention of the action is to provide the
debtor with short-term debt relief, debt service morato-
rium extended by creditors should be classified as debt
rescheduling, provided there is some formal process that
demonstrates agreement on behalf of both the debtor
and creditor, such as the exchange of letters, to delay
payment. In such instances, arrears are not created. In
the standard presentation for the debtor, a debit entry is
recorded under the appropriate instrument represent-
ing the repayment of obligations as they fall due with
a credit entry under the same instrument representing
the creation of a new debt. In the analytic presentation
of the debtor economy, debit entries of obligations fall-
ing due in the current period are recorded above-the-
line, and contra-entries are recorded as rescheduling
of existing debt under other investment liabilities in
exceptional financing.

B. Transactions Related to Debt Reorganization
1. New money facilities

A2.63 In some debt reorganization arrangements
to assist the debtor to overcome temporary balance of
payments difficulties, new money facilities are agreed
with the creditor to be used to repay maturing debt
obligations. In the standard presentation, drawings on
the new money facilities are recorded by the debtor as
a credit, and offsetting debit entries are made under
the appropriate instrument, such as reserve assets. As
the maturing debt obligations are paid, debit entries
are recorded under the debt instrument for principal
amounts falling due and under income for interest
accrued in the current period. In the IIP the liabilities
(assets) of the debtor (creditor) are increased by the
new borrowing.

A2.64 In the analytic presentation, a credit entry for
the full amount borrowed is recorded under drawings
on new loans within exceptional financing, with the
offsetting debit entry under reserve assets. Scheduled
debt payments out of the proceeds of the new borrow-
ings are not regarded as exceptional financing; that is,
debit entries are made above-the-line and offsetting
entries under reserve assets, but advance repayments
of debt for balance of payments purposes from reserve
assets are recorded as debit items under exceptional
financing under the relevant financial instrument. If
the terms of the new borrowings are concessional, the
creditor is providing a transfer to the debtor. Debt con-
cessionality is discussed below.

2. Defeasance
A2.65 Defeasance is a technique by which a debtor
exactly matches debt service outflows from a set of
its liabilities with financial assets with the same debt
service inflows, and removes both the asset and liabili-
ties from its balance sheet (see paragraphs 8.30–8.31).
Although a debtor may wish to regard the defeased debt
as being effectively extinguished, the Manual does not
recognize defeasance as affecting the debt of the debtor
as long as there has been no change in the legal obliga-
tions of the debtor. That is, the debt should continue to
be shown on the liabilities side and the financial assets
recorded on the asset side of the balance sheet, and the
transactions associated with those assets and liabilities
recorded in the balance of payments provided they are
with nonresidents. If a separate unit is created to hold
the assets and liabilities, the transactions by which the
assets and liabilities are moved to the second institu-
tional unit are recorded in the financial account, if the
second unit is resident of another economy. If the two
units are resident in the same economy but are clas-
sified in different sectors, a reclassification in other
changes in volume account is recorded.
3. Debt write-offs
A2.66 A creditor can unilaterally decide to write off
debt owed to it. No transactions are recorded but the
creditor economy records the reduction in its financial
assets through the other changes in the volume of assets
account. (The corresponding liability should also be
removed from the balance sheet of the debtor, through
the other changes in volume account.)
4. Debt concessionality
A2.67 Debt concessionality has gained increasing
importance in discussions relating to debt relief to the
heavily indebted poor countries. However, there is no
consistent definition or measure of debt concessionality
in economic accounts. In debt reorganization through
the Paris Club, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative and similar arrangements, debt
reduction in present value terms is calculated using a
market-based discount rate, usually the OECD’s Com-
mercial Interest Reference Rate (CIRR).^9 The differ-
ence between the nominal value of the applicable debt

(^9) These rates are determined on the fifteenth day of each month
for applicable currencies on the basis of secondary market yields on
government bonds with residual maturity of five years and, in addi-
tion, three and seven years for the Canadian dollar, the U.S. dollar,
and the euro.
Appendix 2 g Debt Reorganization and Related Transactions

and its present value is the amount of capital transfer
derived from the debt reorganization arrangements.

A2.68 Where such transfers are significant, countries
are encouraged to provide these data as a supplemen-
tary^10 item to the standard components. The recording
should be made as a one-off transaction at the point
of loan origination equal to the difference between the
nominal value of the debt and its present value (using a
relevant market discount rate such as the CIRR). For a
new loan, this approach would require information on
the market interest rate at inception and the contractual
interest rate—with the market interest rate as the dis-
count rate and the difference the value of the transfer.
This approach has the advantage of considering all the
possible sources of transfers in debt concessionality—
maturity period, grace period, frequency of payments,
interest rate, and other applicable costs—and is consis-
tent with nominal valuation of loans. In addition, this
approach is consistent with the economic equivalence
between a concessional loan of say, 100 units with an
embedded grant element of 35 percent, and a commer-
cial loan of 100 units combined with a direct grant of 35

(^10) The advantage of a supplementary item in the accounts as
opposed to the main body is that while it allows these transfers to
be measured and data disseminated, it would also allow compilers
to develop their approaches over time without affecting the main
accounts.
units. The transfer value is calculated at the time it hap-
pens, that is, at the inception of the debt, as the difference
between its nominal value and its present value using the
payment stream and the current market interest rate as
the discount factor.
A2.69 If the loan is retired before maturity and
replaced by a new loan, adjustment of the previously
recorded transfers is required. This means that the
value of any transfers not yet received on the original
loan that is replaced would need to be subtracted from
the original transfer value calculated; otherwise, the
amount of concessionality recorded over time would
be overstated.
A2.70 This can be done by recalculating the transfer
at inception using the actual payment schedule outturn,
including the retirement of the entire remaining loan
at the time of rescheduling.^11 This recalculated value
should replace the originally calculated value in the
historical supplementary series, so the historical data
reflect the actual transfers received and do not mix any
new concessional transfer with the value not received
on the original loan, when there may have been a dif-
ferent set of market-related interest rates.
(^11) This retirement value would include any amount that is forgiven
because such forgiveness is recorded as a capital transfer in the
period given.

Regional Arrangements: Currency
Unions, Economic Unions, and
Other Regional Statements
A. Introduction
A3.1 Since the previous edition of the Manual , a
growth in regional arrangements for monetary and eco-
nomic cooperation has been evident, with a particularly
notable development being the creation of the euro in
the broader framework of the European Union. Such
regional arrangements include customs unions, which
have common tariff and other trade policies with non-
member economies; economic unions, which harmonize
certain economic policies to foster greater economic
integration; and monetary and currency unions, which
provide for a single monetary policy across an area.
Concepts and recommendations noted in the chapters
of the Manual for compilation of balance of payments
and IIP statements also apply to these regional arrange-
ments, but beyond these, specific statistical issues arise
that are addressed in this appendix.

A3.2 This appendix begins by addressing issues
relating to currency unions (CUs), because such unions
raise most of the methodological issues and there is
the essential policy need for CU balance of payments
and IIP statistics.^1 Methodological guidance is pro-
vided for the compilation at both the CU and member-
economy levels. The appendix also covers economic
unions (EcUns) and customs unions. As indicated by
Table A3.1, which lists various methodological issues
that can arise from regional arrangements, those issues
relevant for EcUn and customs unions are largely a
subset of those relevant to a CU.

A3.3 Compiling balance of payments and inter-
national investment position statistics for regional
arrangements such CUs and EcUns involves the aggre-
gation of data for two or more economies.^2 In contrast,

(^1) References to specific statistical issues that apply to unilateral
adoption of a foreign currency (such as dollarization) are also
included in this section.
(^2) In this context, “regional” is not used to mean a region within
an economy.
“regional statements” are compiled by an economy
vis-à-vis a grouping of selected economies (geographi-
cal breakdown of statistics). Issues pertaining to this
category of statement are also addressed at the end of
this appendix.
A3.4 IIP data by partner are shown according to
the debtor-creditor approach. In addition, national con-
tributions for compiling financial flows data in CU
and EcUn balance of payments are allocated along the
debtor-creditor approach as a way to ensure bilateral
symmetry.^3 This convention means that cross-border
transactions in financial claims are allocated to the
economy of residence of the nonresident debtor, and
cross-border transactions in liabilities are allocated to
the economy of residence of the nonresident creditor.

B. Currency Unions
A3.5 In a CU, full balance of payments and IIP state-
ments are essential to support the policy analysis at the
CU level. The single monetary policy of the CU requires
the availability of information for the main variables
that affect monetary and foreign exchange conditions for
the union as a whole, among which balance of payments
statistics are of primary importance. In that sense, the
statistical requirements for a CU are the same as for an
economy that issues its own currency.
A3.6 As monetary policy is no longer conducted at
an economy level, the statistical requirements might
appear less necessary for economies that are members
of a CU. However, because economic and fiscal poli-
cies are often still largely defined at the national level,
(^3) As opposed to the transactor principle. Under the transactor
principle, cross-border transactions in claims are allocated to the
economy of residence of the nonresident party to the transaction
(the transactor). Information on the location of counterparties can
be of analytical interest, such as the markets in which or with which
residents transact.

experience has demonstrated the need for a continua-
tion of national balance of payments and IIP statement
for member economies in a CU.

A3.7 The specific statistical issues that need to be
addressed are of three types:

Definitional issues that are central to any discussion
of CU balance of payments and IIP statement.
Application of core balance of payments concepts
to the context of a CU.
Methodological issues arising from the operational
and technical aspects of a CU.
1. Definitional issues
a. Definition of a currency union

A3.8 The adoption of a single monetary policy by
more than one economy can be facilitated through a
range of different types of monetary arrangements.
A situation in which there is the presence of a single
monetary policy among economies, established by an
intergovernmental legal agreement, is defined in the
Manual as a monetary union.^4 A monetary union that
replaces national currencies with a common currency
to form a currency union raises specific methodologi-
cal issues for the compilation of a balance of payments
and IIP. These issues include treatment of the central
monetary authority, the arrangements for reserves man-
agement, and the definition of a domestic currency.

(^4) In compiling data for a monetary union that is not a currency
union, account would need to be taken of the specific institutional
arrangements to determine which principles set out in this appendix
need to be applied.
A3.9 For statistical purposes, a currency union
is defined as a union to which two or more econo-
mies belong and that has a regional central decision-
making body, commonly a currency union central bank
(CUCB), endowed with the legal authority to conduct
a single monetary policy and issue the single currency
of the union. A CU is established by means of an inter-
governmental legal agreement (e.g., a treaty). To belong
to a CU, the economy must be a member of the central
decision-making body, participate in its regular mon-
etary policy decision-making process, and be subject
to its monetary policy decisions. Participation in the
monetary policy decision-making process includes rep-
resentation and voting rights, possibly on a rotating
basis, in the central decision-making body.
A3.10 Monetary arrangements reached by any CU
economy (on behalf of and in line with guidelines set
up by the CUCB) with an economy outside the CU,
such as overseas dependent territories, to regulate the
use of the common currency do not qualify the other
economies to CU membership under this definition.
Similarly, the unilateral adoption of another currency
by third-party economies (e.g., dollarization, euroiza-
tion) is not considered sufficient to regard the economy,
or economies, to be a member, or members, of a cur-
rency union for statistical purposes. Where different
economies establish a common monetary area (CMA)
that allows free movement of finance and a common
exchange control regime with the rest of the world,
but different national currencies remain legal tender in
their respective economies, even if one currency is a
reference currency against which the other currencies
are pegged, the arrangement does not meet the above
criteria to be classified as a CU. The same applies for a
CMA established among members by coordinating the
peg with a third economy.

b. The Currency Union Central Bank

A3.11 The regional central decision-making body in
a CU referred to above is usually the CUCB. A CUCB is
a regional financial institution that acts as the common
central bank for the member economies of the CU. The
CUCB is an institutional unit in its own right, owning
assets and liabilities on own account, and is nonresident
of any CU member economy but resident in the CU.

c. Regional organizations

A3.12 More generally, regional organizations are
a type of international organization. They consist of
those institutions whose members are governments or
monetary authorities of economies that are located in
a specific region of the world. Regional organizations,
which include CUCBs, are created for many purposes
including supporting, guiding, and even governing
aspects of the economic relationships or integration
processes among the region’s economies. Regional
organizations are established by means of an inter-
governmental legal arrangement (e.g., a treaty). They
can be financial (e.g., regional development banks) or
nonfinancial (e.g., relating to the administration of an
economic union) organizations.

d. Centralized and decentralized CU

A3.13 At the time of drafting this Manual , two
kinds of CU are identified. In one model, the CU has
a CUCB owned by the governments of the member
economies with the common currency issued by the
CUCB and central bank operations in each economy
carried out by branches or agencies of the CUCB. This
model, referred to as a “centralized” model, is of the
type observed in Africa and the Caribbean and was in
existence at the time of the publication of the previous
edition of the Manual.

A3.14 In the other model, the CU comprises a
CUCB and CU national central banks (CUNCBs) of
the member economies with the CUCB being owned
by the CUNCBs. The monetary policy decisions are
taken by the decision-making body of the CUCB,
which also coordinates the implementation of the deci-
sions, a primary responsibility of the CUNCBs. This
model, referred to as a “decentralized” model, is the
type developed by the euro area in the 1990s.

A3.15 In some instances, as described ahead, the
specific guidance for reporting differs between the
two models because of the differing institutional
arrangements.

e. Definition of a domestic currency in a CU
A3.16 A domestic currency is defined in paragraph
3.95. The currency issued in a CU is the domestic
currency of the CU. It should always be considered a
domestic currency from the viewpoint of each member
economy, even though this currency can be issued by
a nonresident institution (either another CUNCB or
the CUCB). One consequence is that, in a CU, from a
national perspective, holdings of domestic currency can
be a claim on a nonresident.^5
f. Application of core balance of
payments concepts
Residence
Residence in a currency union
A3.17 The economic territory of a CU consists of
the economic territory of the CU economies that com-
prise the CU, plus the CUCB. Any other regional orga-
nizations that comprise the same or a subset of the same
economies are included in the CU. Within this territory,
the same principles of residence apply as described in
paragraphs 4.113–4.144.
A3.18 So, being a resident of an economy of a CU
necessarily implies being a resident of the CU, along
with the CUCB. Other regional organizations that are
within the CU territory are also resident, except those
whose membership of economies is not the same as, nor
a subset of, those in the CU. Such regional organiza-
tions should be regarded as nonresident of the CU.
Residence status of multiterritory enterprise
located in a CU (or EcUn)
A3.19 Union-wide incorporation for multiterritory
enterprises might create problems in determining the
residence of units and the allocation of activities across
member economies in which the company has opera-
tions, and so present difficulties for national statistics.
In some instances, the location of incorporation or reg-
istration may not be easily allocated to one specific
economy, if the jurisdiction that allows the creation
and regulates the entity is at the union level. However,
the attribution of residence of multiterritory enterprises
also arises in other circumstances, and so the treatment
described in paragraphs 4.41–4.44 should be applied to
multiterritory enterprises located in a CU (or EcUn).
(^5) In the case of a “dollarized economy,” the banknotes and coins
of legal tender should be considered foreign currency as stated in
paragraph 3.96.
Appendix 3 g Regional Arrangements

Institutional sector allocation
A3.20 The institutional sector (and, where relevant,
subsector) classification of regional organizations in
the CU or EcUn balance of payments and IIP that are
nonresident of member economies but resident of the
CU or EcUn should be decided on a case-by-case basis.
However, in the CU international accounts, the CUCB
should always be attributed to the central bank sector
and, for example, a regional investment bank could be
classified as a financial corporation.

Geographical allocation of stocks and flows
A3.21 The compilation of the balance of payments and
IIP statement of a CU or EcUn has implications for the
collection of data at the national level in that the issue of
geographical allocation of stocks and flows, not essential
for national data, becomes fundamental for the compila-
tion of a CU balance of payments and IIP. Compiling the
balance of payments and IIP of a CU from the simple
aggregation of national data would not be appropriate.

A3.22 Thereareseveralreasonsforthis.Thecom-here are several reasons for this. The com-
pilation of a CU balance of payments and IIP by the
simple addition of gross national data would unduly
inflate the gross flows and stocks of the CU because
these would also include transactions and positions
between CU members (“intra” transactions). The addi-
tion of only the net national transactions or positions of
the CU members would solve this problem, but would
provide only net aggregates, because only net balances
could be shown, without separating out debits from
credits in the current account and assets from liabilities
in the financial account. In addition,itisverylikely, it is very likely
that, in practice, intra transactions would not cancel out
entirely because of asymmetries in bilateral figures,
which would result in erroneous aggregate data.

A3.23 Therefore, the compilation of the balance of
payments and IIP of the CU is typically undertaken by
aggregating the national contributions for compiling the
transactions and positions of the CU with nonresidents
of the CU, the so-called extra-CU data. Given the aggre-
gation of data from different economies, it is essential
that the CU member economies consistently follow the
internationally agreed standards for the classification
of transactions and assets and liabilities, and provide
adequate metadata describing their methodology.

A3.24 Data on intra transactions and positions can
also be essential. An example is with portfolio invest-
ment, where liabilities vis-à-vis nonresidents of the CU
may need to be calculated as the difference between
total national securities liabilities to nonresidents and

the transactions and positions in these securities by res-
idents in the other CU economies. The reason for this
is that national balance of payments and IIP collection
systems may not be able to identify whether nonresi-
dent purchasers and owners of domestic securities are
resident of other economies of the CU, or not.^6 In such
instances, asymmetries in intra data would affect the
quality of balance of payments and IIP data of the CU.
A3.25 For direct investment, intra-CU transactions
between a parent company and a branch or subsidiary
located within different economies of the CU would
be classified as domestic transactions of the CU. Given
the different treatment of entities in a direct investment
relationship in the external and domestic accounts, close
cooperation among compilers may be required; for
example, reinvested earnings among entities in differ-
ent CU member economies are recorded as cross-border
transactions in national balance of payments, but are not
recorded as transactions in CU national accounts.
Geographic allocation of transactions in goods
(imports and exports)
A3.26 In balance of payments methodology, the
change of ownership is the principle determining the
coverage and time of recording of international trans-
actions. The consequence of applying the change-of-
ownership concept to merchandise trade is that goods
exports will be allocated to the region of residence of
the new owner and imports to the region of residence
of the former owner. However, international standards
for international merchandise trade statistics, as well as
customs returns in most economies, are based instead on
physical movements of goods across national or customs
frontiers, and the recording of these movements does not
necessarily coincide with changes in ownership.
A3.27 For the recording of goods in customs data,
three concepts are usually used: the economy of origin,
the economy of final destination, and the economy of
consignment (see paragraph 4.150). The concepts of
“economy of origin” (imports) and “economy of last
destination” (exports) are generally acceptable approxi-
mations to the change of ownership principle. However,
in the context of a CU or EcUn, where customs declara-
tions are in many cases completed in a third economy
(^6) For securities, the issuer may not know the identity or residence
of the creditor. Such information can be obtained only from the
intermediary or the creditor. Because of the importance of this infor-
mation, economies are increasingly developing reporting systems to
capture data on a debtor-creditor basis, often through cooperative
efforts, including the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Sur-
vey and Coordinated Direct Investment Survey.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

(economy of consignment) that does not itself obtain
ownership of the goods, double recording of “extra”
trade flows is likely: first at the port of entry into the
CU or EcUn, second at the economy of final destina-
tion. In these circumstances, a combination of the three
concepts is necessary to arrive at a proper recording of
both extra- and intra-union trade. Box A3.1 provides a
numerical example.

A3.28 From a recording perspective, in CUs and
EcUns that still have internal customs border, reliance
on customs data, with economy of consignment data
as supplementary, is feasible. In CUs and EcUns with-
out national customs borders (the most likely situa-
tion), data on economy of origin, the economy of last
known destination, and the economy of consignment
are required from reporters.

Definition of reserve assets
A3.29 Reserve assets shown in the balance of pay-
ments and IIP of the CU should include only those
assets that (a) represent claims on nonresidents of the
CU and (b) meet the criteria described in Chapter 6.
Also, the definition of the reserve assets at the CU level
and at the member economy level should be the same;
in other words, with respect to national data, reserve
assets should include only those assets that qualify as
reserve assets at the CU level.^7
A3.30 Similarly, liabilities classified as reserve-
related liabilities in the national data should include
(^7) In the case of a dollarized economy, reserve assets shown in the
balance of payments and IIP should meet the criteria described in
Chapter 6, Functional Categories.
Appendix 3 g Regional Arrangements
To compile trade data, gross transactions of the
member economies with partner economies outside
the CU or EcUn area are aggregated. This approach
allows for a CU or EcUn’s balance of payments state-
ment to be compiled on a gross (credits and debits)
basis. This is evidenced in the example below, where
economy A is not a member of the union, and econo-
mies B and C are members of the union. Economy
A (economy of origin) exports goods to economy C
(economy of last known destination), and B is the
economy of consignment.

1. Use of economy of origin and economy of last known
destination:

_________________________________Partner economy attribution
Reporting Extra-union
_____________________ Intra-union
economy Economy A Economy B Economy C
_____________________________________________________
Economy A records export: 10
Economy B records import: 10 export: 10
Economy C records import: 10
Union import: 20 export: 10
In this example, the compilation of trade data for
the union (economies B and C) leads to an overesti-
mation of imports (double counting of imports from
A) and also to an unbalanced intra-trade (export of
B to C, not recorded as an import by C). However, if
the union is without internal customs borders and the
goods are cleared on the external border of the union
and released into free circulation, then only the cus-
toms data of Economy B would record the transaction
(imports from A but not exports to C). Subsequent
dispatches and arrivals need to be collected through
enterprise surveys.
2. Use of economy of consignment:

_________________________________Partner economy attribution
Reporting Extra-union
_____________________ Intra-union
economy Economy A Economy B Economy C
_____________________________________________________
Economy A records export: 10
Economy B records Import: 10 export: 10
Economy C records import: 10
Union Import: 10 import: 10 export: 10
If, instead, the concept of economy of consignment is
used, this results in an appropriate recording of extra-
union trade, but not a proper recording of intra-union
trade which is artificially inflated. In addition, in balance
of payments of member economies, the geographic allo-
cation of flows is inaccurate.
3. Combination of the two methods:
In this case, economies record goods transactions of
the economy of origin and the economy of last destina-
tion as imports/exports. Additionally, goods transactions
with intermediary economies are recorded as arrivals/
dispatches. Arrivals and dispatches can be disregarded
when compiling the extra-union transactions of the union.

only those liabilities that qualify as reserve-related
liabilities at the CU level.

2. Issues related to the operational aspects of
acurrencyunion

A3.31 Issues arise from the operational aspects of
the functioning of a CU that relate mostly to the attri-
bution of transactions and positions among member
economies and the CUCB, and do not affect the CU
balance of payments and IIP statements.

a. Treatment of national agencies in a
centralized currency union

A3.32 In a centralized CU, in each member econ-
omy the monetary authority functions are deemed to
be carried out by a national (resident) monetary author-
ity. Typically, the CUCB maintains national offices in
each member economy.^8 This institutional unit, called
“the national agency,” acts as the central bank for that
economy and must be treated for statistical purposes as
an institutional unit that is separate from the headquar-
ters of the CUCB.

A3.33 Transactions among resident units of the
same member economy settled through accounts at the
CUCB are not to be recorded in the national balance
of payments but attributed to the national agency as
domestic transactions and positions.

A3.34 Transactions with nonresidents settled
through the CUCB are to be recorded as transactions
of the national agency in the national balance of pay-
ments according to the nature of the transaction, with
the corresponding entry in the relevant financing item
attributed by the CUCB, such as reserve assets (to illus-
trate this, see numerical example at the end of this
appendix). As changes in reserve assets of a CUCB
in a centralized system for the most part reflect mem-
ber economies underlying external transactions, these
transactions and positions in reserve assets should con-
tinue to be shown in the balance of payments and IIP
of member economies.

A3.35 Transactions of residents with the CUCB,
where the CUCB is acting on its own account, should be
recorded in the national balance of payments according
to the nature of the transaction. For example, debt secu-

(^8) In rare occurrences where this is not the case, for statistical
purposes an institutional unit is to be created to record the central
bank transactions and positions with the residents of the economy
described in this section.
rities issued by the CUCB and subscribed by residents
of an economy of the CU are recorded as portfolio
investment in the national balance of payments.
A3.36 Transactions and positions of the CUCB with
nonresidents of the CU, where the CUCB is acting on
its own account, such as interest on the part of reserve
assets that are not allocated to any member economy
or bonds issued by the CUCB and subscribed by non-
residents of the CU, should not be recorded in any
national balance of payments of member economies but
are included in the balance of payments of the CU.
A3.37 Gross assets and liabilities of member
economies at the end of the period should reflect the
position at the beginning of the period together with
any transactions and other flows recorded during the
period between residents and nonresidents (including
the CUCB). Usually, the member economies will have
a net claim on the CUCB, which represents its share of
the reserve assets of the CUCB. However, if an econ-
omy has a net liability position, transactions in liabili-
ties, other investment, loans, central bank, short-term
(and in the memo item “reserve-related liabilities”),
rather than reserve assets, should be recorded because
the position has the nature of an overdraft.
A3.38 The above approach to recording these trans-
actions and positions reflects current practice in cen-
tralized CUs where a monetary survey is established in
each member economy. In compiling CU data, compil-
ers will need to ensure that assets and liabilities of the
CUCB are not double counted.
A3.39 Any assets held by the CUCB on behalf of
member economies, such as gold, reserve position at the
IMF and SDRs, and more generally foreign assets that
are assigned to member economies in the accounts of the
CUCB, are to be shown in the balance of payments and
IIP of the member economy. Any liabilities attributable to
the economy, such as use of IMF credit, are to be shown
in the balance of payments of the member economy.
b. Treatment of national agencies and reserve
assets in a decentralized currency union
A3.40 The methodology recommended for a cen-
tralized CU is de facto applied in the decentralized sys-
tem where, in each economy, monetary activities with
residents of the CU are carried out by national central
banks having their own assets and liabilities.
A3.41 Where reserve assets are held by the
CUNCBs (i.e., the assets are actually recorded on their
balance sheets), the institutional setting may in certain
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

circumstances result in some restrictions on the effec-
tive control over these assets by the CUNCBs. That is,
CUNCBs may be able to transact in some of the reserve
assets only with the agreement of the CUCB, such as
to ensure appropriate coordination of reserve activity
among CUNCBs. Provided there has been no trans-
fer of ownership to the CUCB and the foreign assets
owned by the CUNCBs can be mobilized by the CU
to meet balance of payments needs, that is, are reserve
assets of the CU, the CUNCB of the member economy
should classify them as reserve assets in their national
balance of payments and IIP, even though the CUNCB
may not have complete control of their use because of
operational constraint at the CU level.

c. Transactions and positions in banknotes

A3.42 For CU balance of payments and IIP statis-
tics, transactions and positions in banknotes should be
treated according to the same principles as for national
data, with nonresident purchases recorded as an increase
in external liabilities (credit) and the corresponding
entry, such as travel, recorded as appropriate. From
a national perspective, holdings of the CU banknotes
issued by a CUNCB in another member economy are
external assets at the same time, even though the cur-
rency is classified as a domestic currency.

A3.43 If the issuer of the banknotes can be identi-
fied, such as in the African and the Caribbean cur-
rency unions at the time of writing, the methodology
described in paragraph A3.42 above can be applied in
the national balance of payments and IIP data. However,
when the issuer of the banknotes cannot be identified,
such as presently in Europe where the banknotes are
collectively issued by the system without any indication
of the economy of origin, this methodology cannot be
strictly applied among the CU members, and approxi-
mations in national data are needed.

d. Other intra–currency union claims and
liabilities

Initial subscription of the CUCB’s capital
A3.44 Initial subscriptions to a CUCB’s capital are to
be recorded in the balance of payments and IIP of mem-
ber economies as assets, other investment, other equity.
All the member economies and the CUCB of a CU must
classify this transaction and position the same.

Initial transfer of reserve assets
A3.45 Claims arising from a transfer of reserve assets
to the CUCB are to be classified as assets, other invest-

ment, under either other equity or currency and deposits,
depending on the nature of the claim. If a CU member
does not fully meet its obligations to transfer reserve
assets to the CUCB, the CUCB reports a claim on the
member economy. Such claims on the member economy
should be classified in its balance of payments and IIP
as liabilities, other investment, other accounts payable–
other, central bank (or general government), short-term.
Intra-CUNCBs and CUCB balances
A3.46 Transactions and positions corresponding to
claims and liabilities among CUNCBs and the CUCB
(including those arising from settlement and clearing
arrangements) are to be recorded for the central bank
under other investment, currency and deposits or loans
(depending on the nature of the claim) in the balance of
payments and IIP of member economies. If changes in
these intra-CU claims and liabilities do not arise from
transactions, relevant entries are to be made under the
“other adjustment” column of the IIP. Remuneration of
these claims and liabilities is to be recorded in the balance
of payments of CU member economies as income on a
gross basis under investment income, other investment.
Allocation of seigniorage
A3.47 Seigniorage is monetary income accruing
from the issuance of currency. Reallocations of mone-
tary income among member economies and the CUCB
where no underlying asset and liability positions are
recognized are to be recorded as a current transfer.
Distribution of profits
A3.48 Distribution of profits of the CUCB should
be classified as income on the financial asset to which
member economies’ subscriptions are attributed.
C. Economic Unions
A3.49 For the purpose of macroeconomic coordina-
tion and cooperation, EcUns formulate specific data
requirements including for balance of payments sta-
tistics, which help assess aspects such as the degree of
integration of the EcUn internal market and share of
trade with economies outside the EcUn.
A3.50 At the EcUn level, the current account, the
capital account, and the direct investment account
are relevant for monitoring economic performance
of the EcUn. However, as different currencies con-
tinue to coexist, and the respective monetary authori-
ties set their monetary policy objectives in terms of
Appendix 3 g Regional Arrangements
developments of monetary variables, interest rates,
and exchange rates, the portfolio and other investment
categories are less meaningful at the EcUn level. For
instance, reserve assets of a union other than a CU are
the sum of the total of the national reserves (without
consolidation) and this total has no specific meaning
at the union level.

1. Definition issues

a. Definition of an economic union

A3.51 For statistical purposes, an EcUn is a union
to which two or more economies belong. EcUns are
established by means of an intergovernmental legal
agreement among sovereign countries or jurisdictions
with the intention of fostering greater economic inte-
gration. In an economic union some of the legal and
economic characteristics associated with a national
economic territory are shared among the different
countries or jurisdictions. These elements include (a)
the free movement of goods and services within the
EcUn and a common tax regime for imports from
non-EcUn economies (free trade zone); (b) the free
movement of finance within the EcUn; and (c) the free
movement of (individual and legal) persons within the
EcUn.^9 Also in an EcUn, specific regional organiza-
tions are created to support the functioning of the
EcUn under points (a) to (c). Some form of coopera-
tion and coordination in fiscal and monetary policy
usually exists within an EcUn.

b. Residence in an economic union

A3.52 The economic territory of an economic
union consists of the economic territory of the mem-
ber countries or jurisdictions, and the regional institu-
tions that comprise the same or a subset of the same
economies and are set up to manage the functioning
of the EcUn.

A3.53 So, being a resident of an economy of an
EcUn necessarily implies being a resident of the EcUn,
and regional organizations that are within the defini-
tion of the EcUn territory are also resident. However,
regional organizations whose membership of econo-
mies is not the same as, nor a subset of, those in the
EcUn should be regarded as nonresident of the EcUn.

(^9) As noted in Chapter 4, an economy, and by extension, an eco-
nomic union, can include physical or legal (special) zones to which,
to some extent, separate laws are applied.

2. Recording issues
A3.54 Because the compilation of EcUn balance
of payments statistics relies on national contributions,
as with the data for currency unions, it is essential
that the EcUn member economies consistently follow
internationally agreed standards for the classifica-
tion of transactions and assets and liabilities, and
provide adequate metadata describing their method-
ology. The discussion in paragraphs A3.27–A3.28 on
the geographic allocation of transactions in goods
also applies to EcUns.

D. Customs Arrangements
A3.55 Regional integration can take the form of
customs arrangements between several economies.
In general, these customs arrangements, based on a
common customs tariff vis-à-vis nonmember econ-
omies, do not raise specific balance of payments
issues. However, when customs unions generate
cross-border flows, such as through a revenue-shar-
ing formula, the recording of transactions and posi-
tions in the international accounts is affected by the
institutional and administrative arrangements of the
customs union.
A3.56 In customs unions such as the Southern Afri-
can Customs Union, there may be a cooperative approach
among members to levying, collecting, and distribut-
ing customs duties. How and when these functions are
undertaken is important for determining the appropriate
recording approach. One or all of these functions may be
assigned to one economy specifically, to all the member
economies collectively, or to a designated international
agency created by the members. Most important, econo-
mies in a customs union are encouraged to agree on
common, appropriate, statistical recording for the benefit
of regional consistency and comparability.
A3.57 The following paragraphs set out some of the
possible types of arrangments.
1. A designated agency levies, collects, and
distributes the proceeds from the duties
A3.58 In this scenario, the designated agency has
the right to levy and collect the customs duties, and
distribute the proceeds. If it is recognized as an insti-
tutional unit, in the international accounts the customs
duties are classified as its own tax revenue (primary
income), and recorded at the time the underlying
economic event occurs that gives rise to the customs

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

duties, along with an increase in financial assets (such
as cash received). The importing economy reports the
accrual of taxes (given that in the balance of payments
import taxes are payable by the importer) and a reduc-
tion in financial assets or increase in liabilities. If the
payment of customs duties occurs after the underly-
ing economic event, the designated agency records
an accounts receivable claim (debit) on the importer
in the importing economy, recorded in the financial
account. The importing economy records an accounts
payable liability (credit).

A3.59 If the designated agency is to distribute the
revenue pool to member economies on the basis of an
underlying economic event (import of goods), it records
a current transfer (debit) (member economies record a
current transfer (credit)) and accounts payable (credit)
(member economies, accounts receivable) at the time
the underlying economic event occurs, the size of which
depends on the nature of the revenue-sharing agreement.
However, if the distributions are made to an agreed
and negotiated formula, the current transfer should be
recorded at the time the member economy acquires an
unconditional claim on the designated agency.^10 At the
time of distribution, the designated agency extinguishes
the accounts payable (member economies extinguish the
accounts receivable), with a corresponding entry of a
reduction in foreign assets (member economies record
increase in foreign assets).

A3.60 The institutional unit could be an interna-
tional agency in which all the transactions described in
the previous paragraphs are between the international
agency and the member economies, or be a resident of
one member economy, in which case all the transac-
tions described in the previous paragraphs are between
that economy and all the other member economies.

2. A designated agency levies duties but
member economies collect duties

A3.61 In a variant, if member economies act as col-
lecting agents on behalf of the designated agency for the
customs duties from importers in their own economy, the

(^10) Sometimes, the revenue-sharing distributions are based on pre-
liminary estimates and require final adjustments to the distributed
revenue at a later stage. Such adjustments to the estimates of the dis-
tributed revenue should be recorded in the periods in which they are
made. So if the revenue to be received by an economy is increased,
a current transfer credit and accounts receivable debit (or cash if
paid when the adjustment is made) for the amount of the increase
is recorded in that period; if revenue to be received is reduced, a
current transfer debit and a negative accounts receivable (or cash if
repaid when the adjustment is made) are recorded in that period.
collecting member economy records an accounts payable
liability in the financial account (credit) to the designated
agency, which records an accounts receivable claim as the
customs duties accrue. The contra-entry will be reflected
as an increase in taxes (primary income) payable by the
importing economy and receivable by the designated
agency. When the member economy makes the payment
to the designated agency, the member economy will record
a reduction in cash, with a contra-entry in the financial
account to eliminate the accounts payable liability.
A3.62 If the collecting economy collects customs rev-
enue due from importers outside their own economy—
that is, it collects customs duties from importers in other
economies in the customs union—it records accounts
payable to the designated agency as well as an increase in
financial assets reflecting the cash received; the import-
ing economy records taxes payable to the designated
agency unit and a reduction in financial assets (increase
in foreign liabilities) to the collecting economy, reflect-
ing, say, the cash paid; and the designated agency records
taxes (primary income) from the importing economy
and account receivable from the collecting economy.
A3.63 Distributions of revenue by the designated
agency are treated as described in paragraph A3.59.

3. Member economies have collective rights to
levy and collect the duties

A3.64 If member economies have collective rights to
levy the customs duties under the agreement, the revenue
attributed to each member economy is either in propor-
tion to the respective underlying economic activity that
gives rise to the customs duties, or not. Each member
economy records customs duties due on their imports on
an accrual basis, regardless of how the revenue is to be
shared or where the customs duties are collected.
A3.65 Should the customs agreement provide for
any member economy to receive a larger share of the
customs pool than is evidenced by the underlying
economic activities, a current transfer element exists
between member economies. The current transfer
is recorded at the time unconditional claims are
established, with a corresponding entry in accounts
receivable/payable.
A3.66 It could be that the ports of entry for the
customs union are situated in one or a small group of
member economies. If so, there could be a discrepancy
between the revenue collected by a member state and that
member’s share of the customs pool. In these circum-
stances, an accounts receivable (importing economy) and
Appendix 3 g Regional Arrangements
accounts payable (collecting economy)^11 are recorded at
the time that such a claim can be established, with the
corresponding entry in a reduction in financial assets
of the importing economy and an increase in financial
assets for the economy that collects more customs rev-
enue than that member’s share of the customs pool. The
discrepancies between the customs revenue collected by
each of the customs union members and the total of each
member’s share of the customs pool share should sum to
zero across the customs union, as the customs revenue
collected by the customs union equals the revenue to be
shared out among member economies.

4. Member economies have collective rights
to levy the duty, but only one member
collects the duties

A3.67 If one of the member economies collects all
the customs revenue, the recording is as described in
the previous paragraphs. Only the collecting economy
will record accounts payable, as all other economies
will have claims on the collecting economy for their
share of the customs revenue.

A3.68 In all the above circumstances, where there
are economic arrangements involving a small group of
economies, to avoid bilateral asymmetries, it is recom-
mended that all the economies involved agree and fol-
low the same recording procedures.

E. Other Regional Statements
A3.69 Similar statements can be compiled on a
regional basis to show the CU’s or EcUn’s external
transactions with, or position vis-à-vis, another selected
group of economies or a particular economy. These are
known in the Manual as data by partner economy and
are covered in paragraphs 4.146–4.164.

1. Recording principles

a. General

A3.70 Concepts and recommendations noted in the
chapters of the Manual for compilation of balance of
payments and IIP statements also apply to regional
statements, but specific references to residents of the
relevant foreign economy or group of economies should
be substituted for the general references to nonresidents

(^11) Net recording of accounts payable or receivable might be appro-
priate when a member economy both is to receive more (less) of
the customs pool than is evidenced by the underlying economic
activities, and collects more (less) of the revenue than its share of
the revenue pool.
or the rest of the world. This substitution should be
made for all transactions and positions.
b. Current and capital accounts
A3.71 In the current account, as noted in previous
paragraphs, trade in goods—reflecting the change of
ownership principle associated with coverage of this
item—generally would show exports allocated to the
region of residence of the new owner and imports allo-
cated to the region of residence of the former owner.
For trade in services, allocation would be to the region
where the provider or acquirer of the service is resident
and, for income, the region on which the resident has
the associated financial claim or liability. For transfers
(current and capital), allocation would be to the region
of the donor or recipient, as appropriate.
c. Financial account and positions
A3.72 In the financial account and position data,
consistent with paragraph A3.4, allocation should be on
the basis of the debtor-creditor principle.^12

2. Specific recording issues
a. Multilateral settlements
A3.73 Although a balance of payments statement vis-
à-vis the rest of the world, whether for an economy or
for a CU or EcUn, should in concept balance, any state-
ment vis-à-vis a subset of nonresidents generally does
not. For instance, a resident in the compiling economy
may make payment to or accept payment from a non-
resident (resident of economy A) in the form of a claim
on another nonresident (resident of economy B). This
situation occurs when a currency is used in international
transactions by other economies for making settlements.
The discrepancies resulting from the allocation of trans-
actions in real resources to the region of the nonresident
owner or transactor and changes in financial items to the
region of the nonresident creditor or debtor, however, are
explicitly recognized by presenting a regional statement
compiled in that way. Thus, an entry is provided under
the item multilateral settlements to restore an accounting
balance by serving as an offset to the discrepancies in the
regional statement. That item may be seen to represent,
in concept, the settlement of an imbalance in the compil-
ing economy’s transactions with one region by a transfer
to or from that region of claims on, or liabilities to, some
other region or regions.

(^12) As noted above, information on the basis of the transactor prin-
ciple can also be of analytical interest.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

A3.74 The data needed to compile statistics on multi-
lateral settlements, however, are seldom available. In prac-
tice, therefore, the item is usually derived as a residual;
however, it can be calculated only in combination with the
item for net errors and omissions, which is also a residual
or balancing item. Inconsistencies or errors of this or any
other kind in classifying entries regionally should not have
any effect on a global statement, which represents the sum
total of all regional statements, because multilateral settle-
ments appearing in individual regional statements cancel
each other when all regions are combined.

b. Selection of regions

A3.75 Guidelines on residence in Chapter 4 are
applicable for determining the residence of the entity.
A region would then comprise an economic territory or
a group of economic territories, because the residence
of any entity is attributed to a specific economic terri-
tory. For transactions and positions vis-à-vis CUs and
EcUn, the territories are as defined above.

A3.76 Because most international organizations are
not included in the economic territory of a economy
or region and so are not considered resident in that
economy, a separate region for international organiza-
tions would be appropriate for allocation purposes. The
regional breakdown that will be relevant for a particu-
lar economy or group of economies depends primarily
on how the statement is to be used. The Manual does
not contain a standard list of economies or regions for
which the reporting economy or group should compile
separate statements.

Numerical Example: International
Transactions and Positions in the
National Data for a Member Economy
of a Centralized Currency Union
1. Opening period

Let us assume that A and B are the only members of
the CU and that the opening position is as follows:

The creation of a notional monetary authority
in each economy entails the attribution of domestic
assets (credit to governments and banks) and liabilities
(banknotes) to each economy as follows:
The CUCB has foreign assets of 500, which in this
instance are all reserve assets, the total reserves for
the union. In turn, the net claim^13 of the national mon-
etary authority on the CUCB represents the foreign
assets (again, all reserve assets in this instance) of the
economy: A and B have reserve assets of 300 and 200,
respectively.
In this example, it is assumed that the CUCB has no
assets and liabilities on “own account,” that is, no assets
or liabilities other than those that reflect positions with
the national economies.
During the periods 1, 2, and 3, the following opera-
tions take place:

Appendix 3 g Regional Arrangements

2. Period 1

Economy A imports 100 of goods from Economy
Y (not a member of the CU), which are paid in
foreign exchange (U.S. dollars).

Typically, the resident of A will acquire the for-
eign currencies he needs from the CUCB, through his
domestic bank. The transactions are as follows:

The bank account at the importer’s resident com-
mercial bank is debited (100) and the importer
acquires foreign currency (100).
The commercial bank acquires foreign currency
from the CUCB (100) and the commercial bank’s
account at the CUCB is debited (from 250 to 150).
For statistical purposes, it will be assumed that the
national agency in economy A holds the account of
the commercial bank, and that in turn the national
agency acquires the foreign currency from the
CUCB.
The CUCB draws down its reserve assets (from 500
to 400), and the account of the national agency is
debited in the books of the CUCB.
Net claims of economy A on the CUCB decline
because of the debiting of the national agency’s
account. This decline in net claims reflects trans-
actions in reserve assets (from 300 to 200).
So under the proposed treatment, imports increase with
the corresponding entry in reserve assets. The balance
of payments transactions and the balance sheet of econ-
omy A would be as follows:

3. Period 2
Economy A exports the same goods to B for an
amount of 120 domestic currency.
The transaction is settled in domestic currency
through the banking system. The transactions are as
follows:
- The resident importer’s bank in B settles in domes-
tic currency with the exporter’s bank through its
accounts at the CUCB. So B’s commercial bank
account at the CUCB is debited (from 150 to 30),
while A’s commercial bank account is credited
(from 150 to 270). As in period 1, for statisti-
cal purposes, it is assumed that the accounts of
the commercial banks are held in their respective
national agencies.
- Net claims of economy A on the CUCB increase
(from 200 to 320) as a result of the crediting of
the national agency’s account and net claims of B
decline (from 200 to 80) as a result of the debiting
of the national agency’s account.
- The transaction is neutral for the CUCB as a
whole, but does affect the intra-CU composition
of net claims on the CUCB, which in this instance
is reflected in changes in reserve assets.
In the proposed treatment of the balance of payments of
A and B, the entries would be as follows:

Economy A Balance of Payments

Goods 100

4. Period 3

Economy B exports the same goods to economy Z
(not a member of the CU) for the amount of 150.

The transaction is settled in foreign currency (U.S.
dollars).

Then the resident of B sells the foreign exchange
receipts to his resident commercial bank in B and
his account is credited (150).
The commercial bank sells foreign currency to the
CUCB (150) and the commercial bank’s account at
the CUCB is credited (from 30 to 180). As in peri-
ods 1 and 2, for statistical purposes, it is assumed
that the national agency holds the account of the
commercial bank.
The CUCB increases its reserve assets (from 400
to 550), and the account of the national agency is
credited in the books of the CUCB.
Net claims of economy B on the CUCB increase
as a result of the crediting of the national agency’s
account.
So, under the proposed treatment, exports increase with
the corresponding entry in reserve assets. The balance
of payments transactions and the balance sheet of econ-
omy B would be as follows:

5. Conclusion
At the end of period 3, the balance of payments of A
and B shows the following entries:

These transactions result in an increase of the reserve
assets of the CUCB of 50, and its balance sheet has
changed as follows:
As can be seen in this numeric example, the change
in reserve assets of the CUCB (+50) from the opening
period to the end of period 3 reflects only transac-
tions with nonresidents of the CU: import of goods of
100 from economy Y and export of goods of 150 to
economy Z.

A4.1 In addition to the statistics on direct investment
(DI) described in this Manual , information on foreign-
controlled enterprises is provided through statistics on
the Activities of Multinational Enterprises (AMNE sta-
tistics) and the closely related Foreign AffiliaTes Statis-
tics (FATS). AMNE statistics cover a range of variables
on these direct investment enterprises, described below.
This wider dataset is compiled separately from balance
of payments and international investment position sta-
tistics (although the data may be collected in the frame-
work of DI compilation), as the data relate to the overall
holdings and activities of direct investment enterprises
rather than just positions and transactions by them with
related enterprises. That is, the objective of AMNE
statistics is to provide an additional perspective on the
impact of direct investment that is complementary to
data on international flows and positions. This appen-
dix is designed to give an overview of the nature and
compilation of AMNE statistics for the information of
balance of payments compilers and users who may be
considering this extended range of information.

A4.2 AMNE statistics may be produced for both
foreign-controlled enterprises in the compiling econ-
omy (a subset of inward foreign direct investment; so

called “inward AMNE”) and foreign affiliates con-
trolled by the compiling economy (a subset of outward
foreign direct investment; so called “outward AMNE”).
In addition, outward AMNE also may cover the activi-
ties of resident direct investors.
A4.3 AMNE statistics can be important for the anal-
ysis of the performance of domestically and foreign-
controlled enterprises, both in absolute terms and rela-
tive to the larger domestic and foreign universes of enter-
prises. Direct investment enterprises may be involved in
activities such as research and development that benefit
the domestic economy but may not be recorded as bal-
ance of payments transactions. Also, data on transactions
in goods and services (with both residents and nonresi-
dents) can provide an additional perspective to balance
of payments data, as transactions by direct investment
enterprises with unrelated persons could be significant.
A4.4 When the General Agreement on Trade in Ser-
vices (GATS) was negotiated, four modes of supplying
services were identified.^1 One of these is mode 3, the
supply of services through commercial presence, i.e.,
direct investment. AMNE statistics for enterprises that
produce services provide information that allows for
the negotiation and monitoring of GATS agreements
and other trade agreements. However, AMNE statistics
are not limited to suppliers of services, and also cover
manufacturing, mining, and other activities.
A4.5 Detailed discussion and recommendations
for measuring AMNE and for FATS is found in the
Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Services
(Chapter IV, Foreign Affiliates Trade in Services Sta-
tistics),^2 in the OECD Handbook on Economic Glo-
(^1) For a discussion on GATS and modes of supply, refer to the

OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Invest-
ment , Chapter 8, FDI and Globalization. A summary is
provided here.

B. Coverage
1. Universe or population

A4.6 AMNE statistics cover those direct invest-
ment enterprises in which the direct investor (or a
group of investors in combination) directly or indi-
rectly holds or controls a majority of the voting
power (i.e., subsidiaries). This differs from the scope
of direct investment enterprises due to the exclu-
sion of associates. These statistics follow the defini-
tion of direct investment discussed in this Manual
(paragraphs 6.8–6.24)^3 in that coverage is defined as
those enterprises with majority foreign ownership of
the voting power by a single investor or a group of
investors acting together; only those enterprises with
foreign control are covered.

A4.7 Countries that are able to do so may wish to
provide supplemental statistics covering cases in which
foreign control may be deemed to be present, even
though no single foreign direct investor holds a major-
ity stake.

2. Economic variables for AMNE statistics

A4.8 Basic variables of substantial interest may
include: sales (turnover) and/or output; employment;
value added; exports and imports of goods and ser-
vices; and number of enterprises.

A4.9 Other variables that might be collected to sup-
plement these data include: assets (both financial and
nonfinancial); compensation of employees; net worth;
net operating surplus; gross fixed capital formation;
taxes on income; research and development expendi-
tures; total purchases of goods and services; and intra-
group exports and imports.

A4.10 The definitions of these variables are given
in the 2008 SNA and in the documents referenced
above. It is also useful to have data for the total popu-
lation or for the domestically-controlled enterprises
on the same basis as AMNE statistics on inward DI,
so performance can be compared with foreign-con-
trolled enterprises.

(^3) And the OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Invest-
ment (fourth edition) ( BD4 ).

C. Statistical Units
A4.11 In principle, most AMNE statistics could be
collected at the enterprise group or enterprise level, or the
level of individual business locations or establishments.
Some indicators, such as total assets, are more naturally
collected from enterprise groups or enterprises than from
establishments. DI statistics are usually collected from
enterprise groups or enterprises, so collection of AMNE
statistics at this same level facilitates linkages between
the two types of data. However, because enterprise groups
and enterprises are more likely than establishments to
have activities in multiple industries, data that are classi-
fied on the basis of primary activity can be more difficult
to interpret for enterprise groups and enterprises than for
establishments. There are thus advantages and disadvan-
tages associated with every basis of collection, and no
recommendation is made as to the appropriate statistical
collection unit. AMNE statistics often will be developed
in the context of existing statistical systems, in which the
statistical units are already defined, and in these cases
there may be little choice in the units used.
D. Time of Recording and Valuation
A4.12 Time of recording and valuation are consis-
tent with the Manual. Flow variables, such as output
or value added, should cover the whole of the reference
period (usually a year), and should be measured on an
accruals basis. Stock variables, such as assets and net
worth, should be as at the end of the reference period.
All transactions and position variables in principle
should be measured at market value.
E. Attribution of AMNE Variables
1. Geographic
A4.13 For statistics on foreign-controlled enterprises
in the compiling economy (inward AMNE statistics), the
geographical attribution should be by the economy of the
ultimate controlling investor. However, to facilitate links
with DI data, compilers are encouraged also to provide
some data in which attribution is based on the economy
of the immediate investor (that is, the first foreign par-
ent). Statistics for foreign enterprises controlled by inves-
tors resident in the compiling economy (outward AMNE
statistics) should be attributed based on the location of
the enterprises whose activities are being described.
2. By activity and by product

A4.14 Ideally, all AMNE variables should be attrib-
uted on the basis of the industrial activities of the estab-
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

lishment or enterprise, according to the United Nations
International Standard Industrial Classification of All
Economic Activities (ISIC).

A4.15 In addition, particular variables such as sales
or output, exports, and imports may be attributed by the
types of products produced and sold. Data on a product
basis would identify the specific types of goods and
services delivered through foreign-controlled enter-
prises and could most readily be compared with data
on goods and services delivered through trade between
residents and nonresidents, and to domestic produc-
tion. However, some variables, such as value added
and employment, do not readily lend themselves to a
product classification.

A4.16 As a longer-term goal, compilers are encour-
aged to work toward disaggregating by product some
or all of the variables that lend themselves to this
basis of attribution (such as sales (turnover) or out-
put, exports, and imports). Product-based statistics are
free of problems of interpretation related to secondary
activities and are consistent with the basis of clas-
sification used for trade in goods and services in the
balance of payments.

F. Compilation Issues
A4.17 There are two basic approaches, not nec-
essarily mutually exclusive, to developing AMNE
statistics. The first is to conduct surveys that directly
request information on the operations of the covered

enterprises (appropriate for both inward and outward
AMNE statistics). The second identifies the subset
of existing domestic enterprise data that is accounted
for by foreign-owned firms (for inward AMNE sta-
tistics only). DI registers may be used in either case
to identify the units to be covered (as well as the
economy of attribution, in the case of inward AMNE
statistics).
A4.18 For both inward and outward AMNE statis-
tics, questions about key AMNE variables might be
added to existing surveys of direct investment transac-
tions and positions. However, because DI surveys may
be conducted more frequently than AMNE statistics
are required (for example, quarterly rather than annu-
ally) and require a quick turnaround, and also because
AMNE statistics are needed for only the controlled
portion of the DI universe, separate surveys may be a
more appropriate way to proceed.
A4.19 For inward AMNE statistics, it should be pos-
sible to link the DI statistics to the existing domestic eco-
nomic statistics (for example, as collected for national
accounts purposes) through the use of information on
ownership structure to identify those resident enterprises
that are foreign-controlled, as well as identifying the res-
idence of the owner. AMNE statistics would be obtained
as an aggregation of statistical variables across the for-
eign-controlled statistical population.
A4.20 Additional questions may have to be added
to DI surveys if information on the ultimate controlling
parent is to be obtained.
Appendix 4 g Statistics on the Activities of Multinational Enterprises
Appendix 5. Remittances
A. Economic Concept of Remittances and Why They Are Important
A5.1 Remittances represent household income from
foreign economies arising mainly from the temporary
or permanent movement of people to those economies.^1
Remittances include cash and noncash items that flow
through formal channels, such as via electronic wire,
or through informal channels, such as money or goods
carried across borders. They largely consist of funds
and noncash items sent or given by individuals who
have migrated to a new economy and become residents
there, and the net compensation of border, seasonal,
or other short-term workers who are employed in an
economy in which they are not resident.

A5.2 For many economies, remittances represent
a sizable and stable source of funds that sometimes
exceed official aid or financial inflows from foreign
direct investment. Remittances may have a significant
impact on poverty reduction and can finance economic
growth in receiving economies.

A5.3 The Manual identifies standard components
and provides supplementary items to allow compilation
of remittance aggregates. No single data item in the bal-
ance of payments framework comprehensively captures
transactions in remittances. This appendix explains the
different items needed to calculate remittance aggregates
and the relationships between the different aggregates.

A5.4 Remittances are mainly derived from two
items in the balance of payments framework: income
earned by workers in economies where they are not
resident (or from nonresident employers) and transfers
from residents of one economy to residents of another.
The definitions of those items, as well as other relevant

(^1) The balance of payments accounts definitions of remittances are
somewhat broader than those resulting from movement of persons,
because they are not based on the concepts of migration, employ-
ment, or family relationships.
definitions and concepts, are set out below. The stan-
dard components related to remittances are discussed
in Section B, and supplementary items are covered in
Section C. Section D identifies related data series that
are often raised in the context of remittances but are not
included in the definitions as such. Section E discusses
the application of balance of payments concepts on
remittances, and Section F considers data by partner
economy. Table A5.1 shows components required for
compiling remittance items and their source. Table A5.2
shows the relationship between the different items.

B. Standard Components in the
Balance of Payments Framework
Related to Remittances
Reference:
IMF, 2009, International Transactions in Remittances:
Guide for Compilers and Users.
A5.5 The two items in the balance of payments
framework that substantially relate to remittances are
“compensation of employees” and “personal transfers.”
Both of these standard components are recorded in the
current account.
1. Compensation of employees

A5.6 Compensation of employees refers to the
income of border, seasonal, and other short-term work-
ers who are employed in an economy where they are
not resident and of residents employed by nonresident
entities.^2 Compensation of employees represents “remu-
neration in return for the labor input to the production
process contributed by an individual in an employer-
(^2) Nonresident employers include embassies and international insti-
tutions as well as nonresident companies (paragraphs 4.131–4.134).
In some economies, income obtained from nonresident employers
is significant.

employee relationship with the enterprise.” Compensa-
tion of employees is recorded gross, before taxes and
other expenses incurred in the economy where the work
is performed. Paragraphs 11.10–11.23 provide more
details. (However, in the derivation of personal remit-
tances, a net measure of compensation of employees is
derived, as discussed in paragraph A5.12.)

2. Personal transfers

A5.7 Personal transfers consist of all current
transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resi-
dent households to or from nonresident households.
Personal transfers thus include all current transfers
between resident and nonresident individuals (para-
graph 12.21). Therefore, personal transfers are a subset
of current transfers. They cover all current transfers
that are sent by individuals to individuals.^3

A5.8 “Personal transfers” replaces an item called
“workers’ remittances” in the standard presentation.

(^3) Families may provide financial support to relatives who are
located but not resident in another economy, such as families sup-
porting relatives who are students or medical patients abroad. Such
transactions involve residents of the same economy and are there-
fore not included in personal transfers. The spending of the relative
abroad will be included in travel.
According to BPM5 , workers’ remittances are current
transfers by migrants who are employed in new econo-
mies and considered residents there. To ensure consis-
tency of time series, workers’ remittances are continued
as a supplementary item. Unlike this previous item, per-
sonal transfers are defined independently of the source
of income of the sending household, the relationship
between the households, and the purpose for which the
transfer is made. This simplifies the definition and brings
it in line with compilation practices applied in many
economies (which did not take account of factors such
as source of income and purpose). So, although it is rec-
ognized that personal transfers will often originate from
migrants sending resources to support their relatives in
their economy of origin, personal transfers as defined in
this Manual are not limited to such activity.

C. Supplementary Items Related to Remittances
A5.9 There are several supplementary data items
in the international accounts including personal remit-
tances, total remittances, and total remittances and
transfers to nonprofit institutions serving households
(NPISHs). They are cumulative measures, as illustrated

in Table A5.2. As supplementary items, their compi-
lation and dissemination is encouraged but voluntary,
depending on the data needs of the compiling economy.

1. Personal remittances

A5.10 Personal remittances are defined as current
and capital transfers in cash or in kind between resident
households and nonresident households, plus compen-
sation of employees, less taxes and social contributions
paid by nonresident workers in the economy of employ-
ment, less transport and travel expenditures related to
working abroad (paragraph 12.27). In short, this item
includes all household-to-household transfers and the
net earnings of nonresident workers.

A5.11 Household-to-household transfers are included
within current or capital transfers, as appropriate, in
the balance of payments accounts. Compilers in both
economies are required to be aware of the sector of the
transacting party on both sides. Personal transfers are
a standard item under current transfers, while capital
transfers between households are a supplementary item
in the capital account.

A5.12 The gross earnings of nonresident workers are
recorded under “compensation of employees,” a stan-
dard component. To derive the relevant component for
the calculation of personal remittances, compensation
is adjusted by deducting taxes, social contributions, and
transport and travel of border, seasonal, and other short-
term workers outside their economy of residence. The
three items that are deducted are all supplementary items
in the balance of payments framework. Social contribu-
tions are defined as “the actual or imputed contribu-
tions made by households to social insurance schemes to
make provision for social benefits to be paid” (paragraph
12.32). Compensation of employees is considered part of

personal remittances because it refers to the earnings of
geographically mobile workers and benefits households
in a territory other than that where the work is performed.
Data users are not always concerned with the length of
stay of a migrant worker (which defines residence), but
instead with all earnings of migrant workers that benefit
their economies of origin, regardless of their residence
status in the host economy.
A5.13 It should be noted that “personal remittances”
also include transfers originating from individuals who
are not migrant workers. On the other hand, the earn-
ings of individuals from the provision of services to
another economy are not included. Paragraph 11.13
provides the definition of an employer-employee rela-
tionship which clarifies the difference between “com-
pensation of employees” and payments for services.
2. Total remittances
A5.14 Total remittances are the sum of personal
remittances and social benefits. Social benefits include
“benefits payable under social security funds and pen-
sion funds. They may be in cash or in kind” (paragraph
12.40). Total remittances include income from individ-
uals working abroad for short periods, from individuals
residing abroad and sending transfers, and social ben-
efits from abroad. Social benefits is a supplementary
item in the balance of payments framework within sec-
ondary income. Total remittances are a supplementary
item in the balance of payments statement.
3. Total remittances and transfers to NPISHs
A5.15 This item includes total remittances and both
current and capital transfers to NPISHs from any sector
of the sending economy. It therefore includes donations,
in cash or kind, from government and enterprise sectors

to charitable organizations in another economy. There-
fore it has a very wide definition that is not closely
linked to migration. In fact, much private and official
aid as well as cross-border sponsorship of educational
and cultural activities (including scholarships) will be
included in this item. Current transfers received by
NPISHs and to NPISHs are supplementary items under
secondary income, whereas capital transfers received
by NPISHs and to NPISHs are supplementary items
under the capital account.^4

A5.16 The identification of NPISHs is not without
problems. Whereas NPISHs are part of the wider house-
hold sector, nonprofit institutions serving other sectors
are not. Although compilers will be able to appropri-
ately identify the NPISHs resident in their economy,
they will find it more problematic to identify NPISHs
in partner economies. This makes the compilation of
debit transactions of “total remittances and transfers to
NPISHs” particularly challenging because the defini-
tion is partially based on identifying the sector of the
transacting party in the partner economy. “Total remit-
tances and transfers to NPISHs” is a supplementary
item in the balance of payments statement.

D. Related Data Series
1. Investment by migrants

A5.17 Migrants frequently invest in their economy
of origin, whether they intend to return or have left per-
manently.^5 Sometimes the attachment to the economy of
origin, and the willingness to invest there, carries over
to subsequent generations of the migrants. Such invest-
ments can take numerous forms, but financial invest-
ments (notably bank deposits and portfolio investment)
and investments in real estate are probably most com-
mon. Small enterprises, located in the economy of origin
and sometimes managed by relatives, can also benefit
from investments by migrants. These transactions are
considered cross-border investments and are therefore

(^4) Of the new supplementary remittance aggregates in the inter-
national accounts, some data users consider “total remittances and
transfers to NPISHs” to most closely match the economic concept
of remittances (see Section A). This measure is broader than the
other remittance aggregates, because it includes current and capital
transfers to NPISHs from any sector of the sending economy (house-
holds, corporations, governments, and nonprofit institutions). Thus,
unlike the other supplementary remittance aggregates, it includes
funds and noncash items that flow indirectly to households, through
nonprofit institutions.
(^5) In this appendix, the term “migrant” refers to a person who
emigrates from an economy of origin and becomes a resident in
another economy.
included in the financial account. Although these invest-
ment flows are of analytical interest in the context of the
economic effects of migration, they are not remittances
in the balance of payments framework.
A5.18 However, in some cases, investment transac-
tions by migrants may be vehicles for the provision
of remittances. When a migrant deposits funds in an
account in the economy of origin, and relatives have
access to these funds, this can be a personal transfer.
For joint accounts a transfer can be recorded when
the funds move across borders rather than when they
are withdrawn (see paragraph 4.145). When a migrant
purchases real estate and relatives occupy it without
paying market rents, or when a migrant sets up an
enterprise and relatives are employed and paid above-
market incomes by this enterprise, personal transfers
could be imputed. In the individual case, the value
of the transfers would be calculated as the difference
between actual transactions and market equivalent val-
ues. In practice, it is difficult to identify such transfers
and calculate their value. If larger patterns are known
to compilers—if, for example, there are large numbers
of migrants buying real estate for use by their relatives
in the home economy—estimates can be made on the
basis of aggregate transactions data and benchmarks.

2. Travel
A5.19 Travel refers to the acquisition of goods and
services in an economy by individuals who are visit-
ing but not resident in that economy. Acquisitions of
goods and services by border, seasonal, and other short-
term workers in their economy of employment are also
included in travel (paragraph 10.89). But travel excludes
the acquisition of valuables, consumer durables, and
other consumer purchases that are included in general
merchandise (paragraph 10.90). The compilation of
the supplementary definitions of remittances requires
that the travel expenses of border, seasonal, and other
short-term workers are subtracted from compensation
of employees. In practice, it may be difficult to separate
travel related to employment from all other travel.

E. Concepts
1. Residence

A5.20 The balance of payments and national accounts
frameworks rest on the identification of residents and
nonresidents respective to each reporting economy.
Because the concepts of personal transfers and remit-
tances are based on the concept of residence rather than
Appendix 5 g Remittances
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

migration status, the concept of migration is not defined
in the balance of payments. This is consistent with the
use of residence criteria elsewhere in the balance of pay-
ments and national accounts frameworks.

A5.21 The residence of households is determined
according to the center of predominant economic
interest of its members. The general guideline for
applying this principle—being present for one year
or more in a territory or intending to do so—is suf-
ficient to qualify as being a resident of that economy
(paragraph 4.117). Short trips to other economies—
for recreation or work—do not lead to a change of
residence, but going abroad with the intention of
staying one year or longer does. “If a member of
an existing household ceases to reside in the terri-
tory where this household is resident, the individual
ceases to be a member of that household” (para-
graph 4.118). Migrants going abroad to work thus
become residents of the host economy (assuming they
plan to stay for a year or longer), but they can join
their original household on return. In addition, there
are guidelines for the residence of specific cases of
students, medical patients, and ships’ crews as well
as diplomats, military personnel, and civil servants
employed abroad in government enclaves. Regardless
of the length of stay in a host economy, these groups
are considered residents of the originating economy
(see paragraphs 4.120–4.123).

A5.22 Residence is important for remittance data
because transactions are recorded differently depend-
ing on the residence status of the individual in his or
her host economy. Border, seasonal, and other short-
term workers are not resident in the economy where
they work and their gross income is recorded as “com-
pensation of employees.” There are no entries in the
balance of payments for the wages of migrant workers
who stay for at least a year and thus are residents of the
same economy as their employer (assuming that their
employer is a resident entity). However, when they send
remittances to a household in another economy, these
are recorded as “personal transfers.”

A5.23 In many cases, it is assumed that the entities
employing workers are resident in the economy where
the work is performed. However, nonresident employ-
ers can have a substantial impact on remittance data.
Nonresident employers include embassies and other
diplomatic missions, international organizations, and
numerous enterprises (see paragraphs 4.131–4.144).
When resident workers work for nonresident employers,
their wages and other benefits are recorded as “compen-
sation of employees.”

A5.24 In addition to current and capital transfers,
some other resource flows may be of analytical inter-
est. While migrant workers reside in a host economy,
their remittances will be recorded as current or capital
transfers. These include gifts in cash and kind to their
household of origin. When returning home to reside,
many migrants bring goods or own assets that will, on
return, be owned by their household of origin. How-
ever, assets that migrants bring with them on return are
excluded from balance of payments transactions, and
so are not transfers. Rather, because the residence of
the owner changes but not the ownership, the change
in assets (such as bank balances and real estate owner-
ship) between economies is recorded as a reclassifica-
tion change, not a transaction.
A5.25 Although the distinction between a transac-
tion and a reclassification of residence is important
for the structure of the system, the effect on the asset
position of households and economies is much the
same whether the resources come through remittances
or through migrants returning home. Data users who
are interested in understanding all contributions that
migrant workers may make to their households and
economies of origin should note this potential mis-
alignment of their data needs and balance of payments
definitions, and should seek to make appropriate addi-
tional estimations.
2. Valuation
A5.26 All valuations in the balance of payments frame-
work are based on market values (paragraph 3.68).
A5.27 Compensation of employees comprises wages
and salaries in cash, wages and salaries in kind, and
employers’ social contributions. Also included are all
forms of bonuses and allowances (paragraphs 11.18–
11.19). All transactions in kind should be valued at cur-
rent market prices, that is, the current exchange value.
A5.28 Transfers in kind should be valued at the
market value of the goods or services provided to the
recipient (see paragraphs 3.71–3.72). The valuation of
cash transfers is clear while transfers of other financial
assets should be recorded at market value.
3. Timing
A5.29 Compensation of employees is recorded on
an accrual basis (paragraph 11.16). Transfers are also
recorded on an accrual basis (discussed in paragraph
3.50). In the case of voluntary transfers, accrual and
settlement are often identical (paragraph 3.52 pro-

vides details on the time of recording of transfers).
However, this is not the case with involuntary trans-
fers (such as taxes or alimony) and they should in
principle be recorded when accrued, although this
can be difficult in practice. Remittances are mostly
voluntary transfers.

Direct Investment
A. Purpose of Topical Summaries
A6a.1 Appendixes 6a–6c bring together topics that
cut across different chapters. They seek to give an over-
view of these topics, in contrast to the main part of
the Manual, which is organized according to accounts
rather than topics. These appendices are designed in a
“signpost” style—that is, they give only a brief intro-
duction and give references as to where more informa-
tion is available in the chapters, rather than duplicate
that information.

B. Overview of Direct Investment
Reference:

OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Invest-
ment, fourth edition.

A6a.2 Direct investment arises when an investor
resident in one economy makes an investment that
gives control or a significant degree of influence on the
management of an enterprise that is resident in another
economy. Direct investment refers to the flows and
positions that arise between parties in a direct invest-
ment relationship.

A6a.3 In operational terms, a direct investment rela-
tionship is defined as arising when an entity has equity
that gives it voting power of 10 percent or more in the
enterprise (paragraph 6.12). The definition also spells
out how control or a significant degree of influence
may be achieved by immediate ownership or indirect
ownership, by a chain of ownership of enterprises that
in turn own other enterprises (paragraph 6.12).

A6a.4 Direct investment relationships and associ-
ated concepts are defined in paragraphs 6.8–6.24. More
details are available in the Framework for Direct Invest-
ment relationships in the OECD Benchmark Definition
of Foreign Direct Investment. Some important terms
are defined briefly in Box A6a.1.

A6a.5 Whereas a direct investment relationship is
defined in terms of voting power, most flows and posi-
tions between the entities, including loans and trade
credit, are classified as direct investment (paragraphs
6.25–6.36). The only financial flows and positions
excluded are debt between selected affiliated financial
corporations and financial derivatives (paragraphs 6.28–
6.29). Debt included in direct investment is called “inter-
company lending” (paragraph 6.26). “Funds in transit”
or “pass-through funds” refer to funds that pass through
an enterprise in one economy to other affiliates, with
the funds not staying in that economy. Unless classified
as debt between affiliated financial intermediaries, such
debt is included in direct investment data but may be
identified separately (paragraphs 6.33–6.34).
A6a.6 The typical direction of direct investment is
from the direct investor to its direct investment enter-
prise. However, there may also be flows in the reverse
direction, and between fellow enterprises, as discussed
in paragraphs 6.39–6.41. Whereas the primary presen-
tation of data in this Manual is according to whether
the item relates to an asset or liability, an alternative
presentation called the directional principle, based on
the direction of the direct investment relationship, can
be derived from the components and is of analytical
interest—see paragraphs 6.42–6.45 and Box 6.4.
A6a.7 Issues associated with direct investment posi-
tions are discussed in paragraphs 7.14–7.25. Valuation
of equity not listed on a market is discussed in para-
graphs 7.15–7.19. Entities that borrow on behalf of their
affiliates are discussed in paragraphs 7.20–7.22.
A6a.8 Issues associated with financial account trans-
actions in direct investment are discussed in Chapter 8.
Reinvestment of earnings is the corresponding entry to
reinvested earnings in the primary income account, and
is discussed in paragraphs 8.15–8.16. The possibility of
imputed direct investment flows arising from goods,
services, or other items supplied above or below value
or with no payment is discussed in paragraph 8.17. Cor-
porate inversion and other restructuring are discussed
in paragraphs 8.19–8.22.

A6a.9 Issues associated with income on direct invest-
ment are discussed in Chapter 11. Reinvested earnings
a re d iscusse d i n pa r ag r aphs 11.33 –11.36, 11.4 0 –11.47,
a nd 11.96 –11.10 2.

A6a.10 In addition, the general accounting princi-
ples, issues of units and residence, and classification
of instruments are also applicable to direct investment.
They are dealt with in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
The case of transfer pricing between affiliated enter-
prises is discussed in paragraphs 3.77–3.78.

A6a.11 The identification of institutional units in
the case of branches; notional resident units for own-
ership of land, other natural resources, or buildings;
multiterritory enterprises; joint ventures; quasicor-
porations identified prior to incorporation; trusts;
and special purpose entities are dealt with in para-
graphs 4.26–4.52 and pertain particularly to direct
investment.

A6a.12 Standard components and selected supple-
mentary items are shown in Appendix 9. Because of
interest in different types of direct investment, addi-
tional breakdowns could be provided on a supplemen-
tary basis for components of particular relevance to an
economy. Examples include partner data, mergers and
acquisitions, funds in transit, industry data, and private
equity. Industry classification is discussed in paragraph
6.50. Identification of mergers and acquisitions is dis-
cussed in paragraph 8.18.
A6a.13 Direct investment data may be classified by
partner economy, as discussed in paragraphs 4.156–
4.157. The partner may be on the basis of the immediate
investor or the ultimate investor or host economy.
A6a.14 Whereas balance of payments and interna-
tional investment position data show the international
flows and positions, another aspect of the impact of
direct investment is on domestic variables, such as
employment, sales, value added, and gross fixed capital
formation. These statistics are called Activities of Multi-
national Enterprises and are discussed in Appendix 4.
Direct investment: is a category of cross-border
investment associated with a resident in one economy
having control or a significant degree of influence on the
management of an enterprise that is resident in another
economy. As well as the equity that gives rise to control
or influence, direct investment also includes associated
debt (except debt between affiliated financial interme-
diaries, specified in paragraph 6.28) and other debt and
equity between enterprises that have the same direct
investor.
Direct investment relationship: A direct investment
arises when an investor resident in one economy makes
an investment that gives control or a significant degree
of influence on the management of an enterprise that
is resident in another economy (paragraph 6.9). Direct
investment covers positions and transactions in equity
and selected debt instruments between entities in a direct
investment relationship.
Direct investor: An entity or group of related entities
that is able to exercise control or a significant degree of
influence over another entity that is resident of a different
economy (paragraph 6.11).
Direct investment enterprise: An entity subject to con-
trol or a significant degree of influence by a direct inves-
tor is called an direct investment enterprise (paragraph
6.11). A direct investment enterprise is either a subsidiary
or an associate (paragraph 6.15).
Control and influence: Control is determined to exist
if the direct investor owns more than 50 per cent of the
voting power in the direct investment enterprise. Such a
direct investment enterprise is a subsidiary. A significant
degree of influence is determined to exist if the direct
investor owns from 10 to 50 percent of the voting power
in the direct investment enterprise. Such a direct invest-
ment enterprise is an associate. The control or influence
may be immediate (through ownership of voting power)
or indirect (through ownership of enterprises that in turn
have voting power). More detail on the identification of
control and influence is given in paragraphs 6.11–6.14.
Fellow enterprise: An enterprise is a fellow enterprise
of another if the two enterprises have the same immediate
or indirect direct investor, but neither is an immediate or
indirect direct investor in the other (paragraph 6.17).
Affiliate: Entities in an immediate or indirect direct
investment relationship with each other, or that have the
same immediate or indirect direct investor are all affil-
iates of each other. That is, affiliates of an enterprise
consist of its immediate or indirect direct investor(s), its
immediate or indirect direct investment enterprise(s), and
its fellow enterprise(s).
Reverse investment: Reverse investment arises when
a direct investment enterprise owns some, but less than
10 percent of the voting power in, or has lent funds to, its
immediate or indirect direct investor (paragraph 6.40).

Appendix 6a g Topical Summary—Direct Investment
Appendix 6b. Topical Summary—Financial Leases
Reference:

2008 SNA, Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues.

A6b.1 A financial lease is a contract under which
the lessor as legal owner of an asset conveys sub-
stantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of
the asset to the lessee. The economic nature of the
arrangement is that the lessor is providing a loan to
allow the lessee to acquire the risk and rewards of
ownership, but the lessor retains legal title as col-
lateral for the loan. Therefore, a financial lease is an
example of where economic ownership differs from
legal ownership. The arrangement is treated as a trans-
action in the relevant asset financed by a loan, which
is repaid in full or in most part by payments by the
lessee. Financial leases are also called finance leases
or capital leases. For further details of the definition,
see paragraphs 5.56–5.57.

A6b.2 Financial leases are distinguished from oper-
ating leases (see paragraphs 10.153–10.157), in which
neither legal nor economic ownership changes, and the
rentals are recorded as services. In terms of underly-
ing economic processes, although both operating and
financial leases have similar forms, the essence of a
financial lease is seen as being a loan, whereas the
operating lease is seen as providing a service. That is,
the operating lease provider has a stock of assets, which

it wants to provide to other entities, and provides vary-
ing degrees of backup support. In contrast, the financial
lease provider is usually a financier and operates a lot
like a lender except that the lessor has the additional
collateral of legal ownership of the assets. Accounting
standards also recognize this distinction.
A6b.3 As a result of this treatment, a cross-border
financial lease will give rise to the following entries in
different accounts:
A loan liability of the lessee and a loan asset of the
lessor are recorded to the total value of the asset
acquired. The outstanding amount is shown in the
IIP (see paragraph 7.57);
The creation of the loan and the subsequent repay-
ments of the loan (including, at maturity, the return
of the asset to the lessor or its purchase by the
lessee) are recorded under loan transactions in the
financial account;
The asset subject to the lease is regarded as being
purchased by the lessee, so there is a change of eco-
nomic ownership of the asset (usually goods) from
the lessor to lessee. If cross-border and involving a
produced asset, this change of ownership is shown
in the goods and services account (see paragraph
10.17(f)). If the produced asset is returned to the
lessor at the maturity of the contract, there is a
change of economic ownership from the lessee
to lessor, which is also recorded in the goods and
services account;
Explicit fees and FISIM are incurred on the loan
if the lender is a financial corporation and these
amounts are included in “financial services” (see
paragraphs 10.118–10.136); and
Interest is accrued on the loan (see paragraph
11.73).
A piece of imported equipment worth 1,000 is pro-
vided under a financial lease from a nonresident financial
corporation. The lease begins on January 1, an annual
payment of 140 is made on December 31 each year for 10
years, at which time the lessee has the option to purchase
the equipment at an agreed price. The contract is based
on an interest rate of 7 percent per annum, while the refer-
ence rate of interest is 5 percent per annum.

For the economy of the lessee, the following entries
are made in the first two and final years:

Year 1 Credit Debit

Current Account:
Goods 1,000
Services—Financial services (FISIM) 20
Primary Income—Investment income 50
Financial Account:
Other investment—Loans 1,000 70
Other investment—Currency and
deposits 140

Accrued interest is 70, of which 20 is FISIM and 50
is pure interest. The value of the loan debt is 930 at the
end of year 1 (1000 + 20 + 50 – 140)

Year 2 Credit Debit

Current Account:
Services—Financial services (FISIM) 18.6
Primary Income—Investment income 46.5
Financial Account:
Other investment—Loans 74.9
Other investment—Currency and

Box A6b.1. Numerical Example of Financial Lease
Accrued interest is 65.1, of which 18.6 is FISIM and
46.5 is pure interest. The value of the loan debt is 855.1
at the end of year 2 (930 + 18.6 + 46.5 – 140)

Accrued interest is 11.3, of which 3.2 is FISIM and
8.1 is pure interest. The residual value of the good pur-
chased is 32.8, which is recorded as a goods transaction
if the good is returned to the lessor (as in the example)
rather than the lessee purchasing it.

Topical Summary—Insurance,
Pension Schemes, and
Standardized Guarantees
A. General Issues
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues.
A6c.1 Insurance provides individual institutional
units exposed to certain risks with financial protection
against the consequences of the occurrence of specified
events. In addition, insurers often act as financial inter-
mediaries who invest funds collected from policyhold-
ers in financial or other assets to meet future claims.^1

A6c.2 Pension schemes are established for the pur-
pose of providing benefits for retirement or for invalid-
ity of specific groups of employees. Pension schemes
may be operated by a separately constituted fund or
by a fund that is part of the employer, or be unfunded.
Pension funds are similar to insurance in that they act
as intermediaries for investing the funds for their ben-
eficiaries and redistribute some risks.

A6c.3 Insurance and pension fund operation have com-
mon features, but can be distinguished in that life insur-
ance and pension funds include a large saving component,
whereas the objective of nonlife insurance (including term
life insurance) is largely undertaken to pool risk.

A6c.4 The transactions undertaken by insurers
include charging premiums, paying claims, and invest-
ing funds. Similarly, pension funds’ transactions include
receiving contributions, paying benefits, and investing
funds. To analyze the underlying economic nature of
these operations, it is necessary to rearrange these pro-
cesses to derive the service, investment income, transfer,
and investment elements. Users may also be interested in
supplementary data on insurance transactions before the

ance company to pay the policyholder under the terms of the policy
because an insured event has occurred. “Claim” is also used in this
Manual to mean financial asset.
adjustments discussed in this section, particularly data on
premiums and claims. (Box A6c.1 provides a numerical
example to show the calculation of the derived items for
service, investment income, transfers, and investment.)
A6c.5 Aspects of insurance are dealt with in several
chapters:

Insurance corporations and pension funds are
defined as institutional subsectors in paragraphs
4.88–4.89;
Insurance reserves, pension entitlements, and pro-
visions for standardized guarantees are defined as
financial instruments in paragraphs 5.62–5.68 and
as part of the other investment functional category
in paragraph 6.61;
The measurement of insurance reserves in the IIP
is discussed in paragraphs 7.63–7.68;
Financial account entries are discussed in para-
graphs 8.46–8.49;
Other changes in volume associated with insurance
reserves and provisions are discussed in paragraph
9.24;
Insurance and pension services are discussed in
paragraphs 10.109–10.117;
The investment income accruing to policyhold-
ers and contributors is discussed in paragraphs
11.77–11.8 4 ; a nd
The transfers associated with these schemes are
discussed in paragraphs 12.41–12.46 and 13.24.
A6c.6 Cross-border insurance is particularly com-
mon in specialized areas such as reinsurance and high-
value items such as insurance of ships and aircraft. For
some small economies, the small size of their risk pool
means that a wider range of items tends to be insured
with nonresidents. With international mobility of popu-
lation, life insurance and pensions can also occur cross-
border on a significant scale.
B. Nonlife Insurance
Reference:

2008 SNA , Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues, Part 1.

1. Types of nonlife insurance

A6c.7 Types of nonlife insurance include accident
and health; term life; marine, aviation, and other trans-
port; fire and other property damage; pecuniary loss;
general liability; and credit insurance.

A6c.8 Direct insurance is between an insurance
company and the public. Reinsurance is insurance
where both parties to the policy are providers of insur-
ance services. That is, reinsurance allows insurance
risk to be transferred from one insurer to another. Many
insurers act as both direct insurers and reinsurers. There
may be chains of transferring risk, from insurer to rein-
surer to secondary reinsurer and so on. Reinsurance
companies and their policyholders are often residents
of different economies because of the specialized func-
tions of reinsurance and the objective to spread risk. A
direct insurer may pass on an entire set of risks (i.e., the
Appendix 6c g Insurance, Pension Schemes, and Standardized Guarantees
1. Basic information
This example covers policies of resident insurers with nonresident policyholders; the same
principles apply for nonresident insurers with resident policyholders, although the availabil-
ity of data is less in practice, so that ratios may be needed for some items, as discussed in
Box 10.4.
Gross premiums receivable from abroad = 135
Gross premiums received from abroad = 150
Reserves relating to prepayments—beginning of period = 40
Reserves relating to prepayments—end of period = 55
Net increase in reserves relating to prepayments = 15
Investment income attributable to nonresident policyholders = 8
Claims payable abroad = 160
Claims paid to abroad = 155
Reserves relating to claims incurred—beginning of period = 10
Reserves relating to claims incurred—end of period = 15
Net increase in reserves for claims incurred but not paid = 5
Adjustment for volatility in claims payable = –40
(i.e., expected long-term level of claims would be 120, that is 160 – 40)
2. Derived items
Goods and services account:
Insurance service (credits)
=gross premiums receivable plus premium supplements less expected claims (i.e.,
expected claims is derived as actual claims payable plus adjustment for volatility
= 135 + 8 – 120
= 23
(Note: not taking into account the volatility would lead to a negative value of services: –17.)
Primary income account:
Investment income attributable to policyholders (debits) = 8
Secondary income account:
Net premiums receivable (credits)
= gross premiums receivable less service = 135 + 8 – 23 = 120
Claims payable (debits) = 160
Financial account:
Insurance reserves (increase in liabilities to policyholders) = 20 (= 15 + 5)
Currency and deposits (increase in assets of resident insurers) = –5 (= 150 – 155)
IIP—Liabilities
Insurance reserves (prepayments and claims incurred) —beginning of period = 50 (= 40 + 10)
Insurance reserves (prepayments and claims incurred) —end of period = 70 (= 55 + 15)

Box A6c.1. Numerical Example of Calculations for Nonlife Insurance
direct insurer is like a retailer), a proportion of risks, or
the risk of claims being more than a specified amount
(e.g., arising from a catastrophic loss) to a reinsurer.
Because it is often used as protection against exposure
to large losses, reinsurance is particularly likely to be
subject to lumpy transactions.

A6c.9 The principles for measurement of reinsur-
ance and direct insurance services are the same. They
are shown as separate items on a supplementary basis,
as can other components such as auxiliary services and
standardized guarantees.

A6c.10 Freight insurance is a form of nonlife
insurance that raises particular issues for valuation
of goods. Like freight transport, as discussed in para-
graph 10.78, the identification of who pays the insur-
ance and whether it is included in the price of the
good is determined by the FOB valuation concept, as
discussed in paragraph 10.116.

A6c.11 Nonlife insurance is distinguished from life
insurance in that it pays benefits only if an insured
event occurs. That is, nonlife insurance is designed
primarily for pooling risk, rather than as an investment.
For that reason, nonlife insurance claims and net pre-
miums are recorded as transfers, while the equivalents
for life insurance are recorded in the financial account.
In contrast to life insurance, term life insurance ben-
efits are payable only on the death or incapacity of
the insured, and so term life insurance is included in
nonlife insurance.

2. Role of reserves in insurance

A6c.12 Insurance policies are paid in advance, while
claims are paid only after the insured events happen,
sometimes much later. Insurance technical reserves
represent the amounts identified by insurance compa-
nies to account for these prepayments of premiums and
claims incurred but not yet paid. That is, reserves can
be seen as the application of usual accrual accounting
principles. Reserves for claims reported but not yet
resolved, and estimates of claims incurred but not yet
reported, are correctly included, as they relate to insur-
able events that have already occurred.

A6c.13 Insurance corporations in some economies
may also set aside other reserves, such as amounts to
cover fluctuations in claims between periods (e.g., the
increase in claims in the event of a natural disaster).
However, if there is no entitlement by any counterparty
to these reserves, they cannot be recognized as an asset
of the policyholders.

A6c.14 Insurance companies hold assets to meet the
liabilities to policyholders represented by the reserves.
The management of these financial and nonfinancial
assets is an integral part of the business of insurance.
The income generated by these investments has a consid-
erable influence on the level of premiums that insurance
enterprises need to charge (indeed, in some cases, they
have allowed claims to exceed gross premiums earned).
Consequently, the income earned on the investment of
the reserves is treated as being receivable by the poli-
cyholders who are then treated as paying it back to the
insurance enterprises as premium supplements.
3. Value of insurance service output
A6c.15 Premiums and investment income repre-
sent the inflow of resources to the insurance company,
whereas the claims due are the resources allocated to
the policyholders. The margin between these inflows
and outflows is the amount available to the insurance
company to cover its costs and provide an operating
surplus. This margin represents the value of insurance
services provided.
A6c.16 The value of output of nonlife insurance ser-
vices can be expressed with the following formula:
Gross premiums earned;
+ Premium supplements;
–Claims payable;
- Adjustment for claims volatility, if necessary.^2

a. Gross premiums earned
A6c.17 “Gross premiums earned” refers to those parts
of the premiums payable in the current or previous peri-
ods that cover the risks incurred during the accounting
(^2) Alternatively, the formula can be expressed as:
Gross premiums earned;
+Premium supplements;

Expected claims;
where expected claims are based on longer term measures of claims,
taking out the effects of volatility.
The formula can also be expressed in terms of payments:
Gross premiums paid;
+Premium supplements;
Claims paid;
Net increase in technical reserves (including
reserves for claims volatility);
where the technical reserves account for prepayments of premiums
and delays in paying out claims as well taking out the effects of
volatility.
See Box A6c.1 for a numerical example of these calculations.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

period. Premiums earned are on an accrual basis, so dif-
fer from premiums received because insurance policies
are usually paid in advance. In the case of a reinsurer
accepting risks on proportional reinsurance contracts,
gross premiums earned are recorded after deducting the
reinsurance commissions payable to the direct insurer.
Similarly, other gross premiums should be calculated by
deducting any rebates payable to the policyholder.

A6c.18 Insurance premiums are normally paid in
advance, so a measure on an accrual basis differs from
premiums paid by the deduction of prepayments for
insurance cover in future periods and adds back cover for
the current period that was prepaid in previous periods.

b. Premium supplements

A6c.19 Investment income earned on the assets
invested to meet insurance companies’ provision liabili-
ties is attributable to insurance policyholders. The income
is recorded in the primary income account as discussed
in paragraphs 11.77–11.84 and A6c.26. The same value
is then treated as being paid back to the insurance com-
panies as premium supplements. Premium supplements
are added to premiums in the calculation of the value of
insurance services, as shown in Box A6c.1.

c. Claims payable

A6c.20 Claims payable are claims for events that
occurred within the accounting period. Claims pay-
able include claims paid within the accounting period
plus changes in the reserves against outstanding claims.
That is, claims on an accrual basis are recognized as
due when an event takes place that gives rise to a valid
claim, whether or not paid, settled, or reported during
that period.

d. Adjustments for claims volatility

A6c.21 Adjustments for claims volatility should be
included in the calculation for lines of insurance sub-
ject to fluctuations. For example, major catastrophes
such as earthquakes and hurricanes may be expected
to occur, on average, once in each several years. If only
claims incurred during a single accounting period are
used in the formula, the resulting values of insurance
services could be erratic, and even negative in cata-
strophic periods, and so are an inadequate measure of
the production and pricing of insurance. In such cases,
an adjustment to claims due should be made, to reflect a
longer-term view of claims behavior, in line with insur-
ance decision making. In periods when large values of

claims are incurred, the adjustment would be negative
(thus causing an increased value of the service), while
in other periods, the adjustment would be positive (thus
reducing the value of the service). However, for some
types of insurance, there is limited volatility and no
adjustment is necessary.
A6c.22 The adjustments for claims volatility show
the difference between actual claims in a particular
period and a normally expected level of claims. The
expected level of claims may be calculated according
to one of the following methods:
(a) The expectations approach is based on an esti-
mate of expected claims, using smoothed past
figures of gross cla ims incur red or smoothed past
ratios of gross claims incurred over premiums,
applied to current premiums. It replicates the ex
ante model used by insurers to price their pre-
miums on the basis of their expectations. When
accepting risk and setting premiums, insurers
consider their expectation of loss;
(b) The accounting approach is based on changes
in insurers’ equalization reserves and changes
in own funds to account for the volatility of
claims. In contrast to the expectation approach,
the accounting approach uses ex post data, that
is, observed claims incurred. It is to be noted
that if changes in own funds are introduced in
one given period to dampen the volatility of a
claim in case of catastrophe, the rebuilding of
own funds after this period will also intervene
(with an inverse sign) in the formula for the next
periods. Practices for calculation of equalization
reserves vary, so they may not be sufficient to
cover all volatility in claims; or
(c) The sum of costs plus “normal” profit approach
consists in obtaining a measure of output as
the sum of costs plus an estimate of “normal”
profit. The estimate of “normal” profit generally
implies the use of smoothed past actual profits.
Thus this approach is, in practice, similar to the
expectation approach. “Normal” profit is indeed
equal to premiums + adjusted premium supple-
ments – adjusted claims – costs.
e. Reinsurance
A6c.23 As explained in paragraph A6c.8, reinsur-
ance allows insurance risk to be transferred from one
insurer to another. The transactions between the direct
insurer and the reinsurer are recorded as an entirely
Appendix 6c g Insurance, Pension Schemes, and Standardized Guarantees
separate set of transactions and no consolidation takes
place between the transactions of the direct insurer
as issuer of policies to its clients on the one hand and
the holder of a policy with the reinsurer on the other.
The output of reinsurance is measured in a way simi-
lar to that for direct nonlife insurance. However, there
are some payments peculiar to reinsurance. These are
commissions payable to the direct insurer under pro-
portionate reinsurance and profit sharing in excess of
loss reinsurance. Once these are taken into account the
output of reinsurance can be calculated as:

Total actual premiums earned less commissions
payable;
+ Premium supplements;
Adjusted claims incurred and profit sharing.
4. Exports and imports of insurance services
A6c.24 The formula for total production of insur-
ance services stated in paragraph A6c.16 includes ele-
ments that may only be able to be observed by insurers
in aggregate. For exported and imported insurance ser-
vices, which represent the output provided to a subset
of policyholders, additional methods are required to
allocate totals.

A6c.25 Usually, ratios will be able to be used to
make estimates. The case of imports is particularly
difficult, as the insurance companies are not residents
in the economy of compilation and so data collection
is constrained. In each case, the objective is to find
a result consistent with the overall method, after tak-
ing into account which information is available in the
circumstances. Possible methods are discussed in para-
graph 10.114 and Box 10.4.

5. Investment income attributable to
insurance policyholders (primary income
account)

A6c.26 Investment income earned on the assets
invested to meet insurance companies’ provision lia-
bilities is attributable to insurance policyholders. The
income is recorded in the primary income account as
discussed in paragraphs 11.77–11.84. The same value is
then treated as being paid back to the insurance com-
panies as premium supplements in the calculation of
the value of insurance services, as shown in paragraph
A6c.19 and Box A6c.1 (and consequently increases the
value of net premiums, which is gross premiums less
the value of insurance services).

6. Net insurance premiums (secondary
income account)
A6c.27 Net insurance premiums are gross premi-
ums earned less the service charge. (Gross premiums
were discussed in paragraph A6c.17 in the context of
deriving the service charge.) Net insurance premiums
are shown as current transfers. They are discussed in
paragraphs 12.41–12.42.
7. Claims receivable or payable (secondary
income account)
A6c.28 Claims incurred during the period are gener-
ally shown as current transfers. They are discussed in
paragraphs 12.44–12.46 and in paragraph A6c.20 in the
context of deriving the service charge. In exceptional
cases, they may be classified as capital transfers, as dis-
cussed in paragraph 13.24. The stock of claims outstand-
ing is recognized as a financial asset or liability and is
shown in the IIP (see paragraphs 5.64 and 7.63–7.68).

C. Life Insurance and Annuities
Reference:
2008 SNA , Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues, Part 1.D.
A6c.29 Life insurance is distinguished from nonlife
insurance in paragraph A6c.11. Life insurance involves
a stream of payments by the policyholder in return for
a lump sum at the end of the policy. Annuities are the
reverse, where a stream of payments is made by the
insurer in return for a lump sum at the beginning of the
policy. Both direct insurance and reinsurance also exist
for life insurance and annuities.
A6c.30 The principles for the measurement of life
and nonlife insurance are similar. However, in the case
of life insurance, the net premiums and payments of ben-
efits are recorded in the financial account, rather than
the secondary income account. This treatment follows
from the role of life insurance as paying benefits even
without an insured event occurring, and therefore operat-
ing mainly as a way for policyholders to build assets; in
contrast, nonlife insurance operates to redistribute costs
among policyholders by transfers. Because life insurance
is based on managing large values of assets, the premium
supplements can be relatively large.
A6c.31 The value of output of life insurance and
annuity services can be expressed with the following
formula:
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Grosspremiumsearned;
+ Premium supplements;
Benefits due;
Increases (+ decreases) in life insurance reserves
(actuarial reserves and reserves for with-profits
insurance).
The formula is basically the same as for nonlife insur-
ance,exceptthatthepaymentstopolicyholdersare
calledbenefitsinsteadofclaims,andreservesare
added to account for the accrual of future benefits.
Also, changes in reserves are taken into account.

ticular policyholders because they consist of allocations
to the actuarial reserves and reserves for with-prof-
its insurance policies to build up the sums guaranteed
under these policies. Changes in the actuarial reserves
and reserves for with-profits insurance include the pro-
vision made for bonuses payable in future.

A6c.33 It is common with life insurance policies for
amountstobeexplicitlyattributedbytheinsurancecor-
poration to the policyholders in each year. These sums
are often described as bonuses. The sums involved are
notactuallypaidtothepolicyholdersbuttheliabilities
oftheinsurancecorporationtowardthepolicyhold-
ers increase by this amount. This amount is shown as
investment income attributed to the policyholders. The
factthatsomeofitmayderivefromholdinggainsdoes
not change this designation; as far as the policyholders
areconcerneditisthereturnformakingthefinancial
asset available to the insurance corporation. In addi-
tion,alltheincomefromtheinvestmentofnonlife
reserves and any excess of income from the investment
of life reserves over any amounts explicitly attributed
to the policyholders are shown as investment income
attributed to policyholders, regardless of the source of
the income.

A6c.34 In the case of annuities, the same principles
apply, but the calculation is different because of the
opposite cash flow, and is elaborated in 2008 SNA,
Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Special Issues.

A6c.35 In the current account, in addition to ser-
vices, life insurance gives rise to investment income
attributable to policyholders, as discussed in paragraph
11.81, of equivalent value to premium supplements. For
life insurance, net premiums and benefits are shown as

increases and reductions in insurance reserves in the
financial account. (In contrast, for nonlife insurance,
netpremiumsandclaimsareshownastransfers.)
A6c.36 Life insurance technical reserves are defined
as a financial instrument in paragraph 5.65. They are
classified as other investment in the functional classifi-
cation;seeparagraph6.61.Moredetailsareprovidedon
recording them in the IIP in paragraphs 7.63–7.64, the
financial account in paragraph 8.48, and other changes
in volumes in paragraph 9.24.

A6c.38 Social contributions to social security
schemes are discussed in paragraphs 12.32–12.33.
Social benefits under social security and social assis-
tance schemes are dealt with in paragraph 12.40. These
schemes operate through transfers and do not have
financial account entries because an obligation to pay is
notrecognized.Forfurtherinformationonsocialsecu-

A6c.39 Pension funds are defined as an institutional
subsector in paragraphs 4.89–4.90. Pension entitlements
are defined as a financial instrument in paragraphs
5.66–5.67. These entitlements may be liabilities of pen-
sionfundsorunfundedschemes.Theyareclassified

ance and pension services are discussed in paragraphs

Appendix 6c g Insurance, Pension Schemes, and Standardized Guarantees
A6c.40 There may be explicit or implicit service
charges for pension schemes. If the charges are implicit,
they are measured in a similar way to those for life
insurance and annuities, namely:

Gross contributions;
+ Contribution supplements;
–Benefits payable;
Adjustment for change in pension entitlements.
A6c.41 Investment income is attributable to benefi-
ciaries of pension schemes and is repaid to the pension
fund as contribution supplements, as discussed in para-
graph 11.82. The investment income payable
(a) for defined contribution schemes is equal to
the investment income on the funds plus any
net operating surplus earned by renting land or
buildings owned by the fund; and
(b) for defined benefit schemes, is equal to the
increase in benefits payable because the date
when the entitlements become payable is closer.
The amount of the increase is not affected by
whether the pension scheme actually has earned
sufficient income to meet its obligations.
The adjustment for change in pension entitlements is
discussed in paragraph 12.38.

A6c.42 Social contributions to pension schemes are
discussed in paragraphs 12.32–12.37. Social benefits are
the amounts payable to the beneficiaries and are discussed
in paragraph 12.40. In the SNA , social contributions are
viewed as both transfers and an investment in the scheme;
similarly, social benefits are viewed as both transfers

and a withdrawal of investment from the scheme. These
different views require an entry for change in pension
entitlements, discussed in paragraphs 12.38–12.39.
E. Standardized Guarantees
Reference:
2008 SNA , Chapter 17, Cross-Cutting and Other Spe-
cial Issues, Part 3.
A6c.43 Standardized guarantees are issued in
large numbers along similar lines. Examples include
export credit guarantees and student loan guarantees.
Standardized guarantees are contrasted with other
guarantees in paragraph 5.68. The guarantors are usu-
ally general government units or financial corpora-
tions. Because the guarantor provides large numbers
of guarantees, it is possible to estimate the risk of
default. A guarantor operating on a commercial basis
will charge fees, meet claims, and earn investment
income in a way parallel to nonlife insurance, and the
value of services, income, and provisions are calcu-
lated in the same way as described for nonlife insur-
ance in Section B of this appendix.
A6c.44 Provisions for calls under standardized
guarantees are defined as a financial instrument and
contrasted with one-off guarantees and financial
derivatives in paragraph 5.68. They are classified as
other investment in the functional classification; see
paragraph 6.61. Changes to provisions for calls under
standardized guarantee schemes not resulting from
transactions are shown as other changes in volume and
are discussed in paragraph 9.24.

Relationship of the SNA Accounts
for the Rest of the World to
the International Accounts
Introduction
References:

2008 SNA , Chapter 26, The Rest of the World Accounts
(external transactions accounts).
IMF and others, External Debt Statistics: Guide for
Compilers and Users , Appendix IV, Relationship
Between the National Accounts and the Interna-
tional Investment Position (IIP).
A7.1 International accounts are closely linked to the
SNA. This linkage is reinforced by the fact that, in most
countries, data on the balance of payments and the IIP
are compiled first and subsequently incorporated in
relevant external account components of the SNA rest
of the world account. There is complete concordance
between the SNA and this Manual with respect to the
delineation of resident units, valuation, time of record-
ing, conversion procedures, and coverage of goods, ser-
vices, income, capital transfers, and foreign financial
assets and liabilities.

Accounting System
A7.2 The SNA uses an underlying accounting system
similar to that used for the balance of payments. How-
ever, the entries for both parties to a transaction (such
as a resident and a nonresident) are included in the SNA ,
rather than just one party (the resident) as in the balance
of payments. As a result, each transaction gives rise to four
entries in the SNA , that is, two entries for each party.

A7. 3 Credits in the balance of payments are called
resources in the SNA , and debits are called uses. The
SNA rest of the world accounts are presented from the
point of view of the nonresident units, whereas the bal-
ance of payments presents the same transactions from
the point of view of resident units. As an illustration,
imports of an economy are shown as resources in the
SNA , that is, an outflow from the rest of the world and
an inflow or use for the resident units.

Classification
A7.4 In general, the classification system is the same
in the SNA and the Manual. The coverage and terminol-
ogy of major aggregates have been fully harmonized.
There is a major presentational difference in that the
international accounts use functional categories as the
primary level of classification for investment income,
the financial account, and the IIP, whereas the SNA
uses instruments and sectors. The functional categories
are not applicable to domestic relationships. However,
the instrument and institutional sector detail in the
international accounts allows the data to be converted
or compared with SNA data. In addition, differences in
classification or level of detail exist between the rest of
the world accounts and international accounts. These
reflect differences in analytical requirements and the
necessity of using, in the SNA , a uniform classifica-
tion scheme for all sectors of the economy. Because
of the use of consistent terminology, links can be seen
between international accounts items and the corre-
sponding SNA items. In addition, to assist in compari-
sons or linking, the listing of standard components in
Appendix 9 includes SNA codes. (Because of the use
of functional categories as the primary classification in
the international accounts, a letter has been added to the
SNA codes for investment income, financial account,
and IIP items to denote the functional category.)
Linkages between Accounts
A7. 5 The terminology of the SNA rest of the world
accounts and the international accounts is the same,
except for some minor differences (e.g., the SNA uses
the external account of goods and services for the goods
and services account, and external assets and liabilities
for the IIP).
A7.6 The SNA coverage of exports and imports of
goods and exports and imports of services is identi-
cal to balance of payments coverage of corresponding
items. In balance of payments statistics, exports and
imports of services are disaggregated in more detail
to provide data for analysis and policy decisions—
particularly for negotiations in international trade in ser-
vices within the framework of international agreements.
The services identified in the balance of payments are
consistent with those of the Central Product Classification
(CPC) —except for the transactor-based items for travel,
construction, and government goods and services n.i.e.

A7.7 Compensation of employees, property income,
and current transfers are defined identically, although
the functional category is used for disaggregation of
investment income in the international accounts. The
major elements of the capital account of the external
accumulation accounts are identical with the capital
account of the balance of payments. The balancing item
net lending/net borrowing in account is identical to the
balance of payments item.

otherwise the same (e.g., financial account entries for currency and deposits are F2, while the corresponding asset and liability positions are AF2). In addition,
reinvestment of earnings is not applicable in the IIP.
A7. 8 The coverage of the SNA financial account
is identical with that of the financial account in the
balance of payments, although the level of detail is
different. Similarly, the coverage of the SNA external
assets and liabilities account is identical with that of
the IIP. However, in the SNA , financial assets are clas-
sified primarily by type of instrument. In the balance
of payments, financial items are classified primarily by
functional category: direct investment, portfolio invest-
ment, financial derivatives (other than reserves) and
employee stock options, other investment, and reserve
assets. The financial instruments classification used in

the SNA and its relationship with the functional cat-
egories and their instrument components used in the
international accounts are set out in Table A7.1.
A7.9 In addition to categories identifying types of
financial instruments, the balance of payments con-
tains an abbreviated sector breakdown (central bank,
other deposit-taking corporations, general government,
other financial corporations, and other sectors) to pro-
vide links with other bodies of economic and finan-
cial statistics such as money and banking, government
finance, international banking, and external debt.

Appendix 8. Changes from BPM5
A detailed list of individual changes made in this
edition of the Manual is provided below. The compari-
son is with BPM5 , as amended by The Recommended
Treatment of Selected Direct Investment Transac-
tions (1999), Financial Derivatives, a Supplement to
the Fifth Edition (1993) of the Balance of Payments
Manual (2002), and IMF Committee on Balance of
Payments Statistics Annual Report (2001). The main
themes behind the changes in BPM6 are discussed in
paragraphs 1.32–1.35.

Chapter 1. Introduction
The title of the Manual is changed to Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Man-
ual (paragraph 1.1).

Procedures are introduced for updating the Manual
(paragraphs 1.37–1.41).

A research agenda for future work is identified (para-
graph 1.43).

Chapter 2. Overview of the Framework
The definition of balance of payments statistics is
limited to transactions between residents and nonresi-
dents (paragraph 2.2; however, practical dimensions
are discussed in paragraphs 3.7–3.8 and 4.152–4.154;
BPM5 paragraphs 13–14).

The Data Quality Assessment Framework, metadata,
and dissemination issues are introduced (paragraphs
2.37–2.39).

Time series issues are discussed explicitly (para-
graphs 2.40–2.41).

Explicit recognition is given to the use of satellite
accounts and other supplemental presentations (para-
graphs 2.42–2.43).

Chapter 3. Accounting Principles
Transactions in external assets between two resident
institutional units and transactions in external liabili-
ties between two nonresidents are not recorded in the
balance of payments as transactions. However, it is
clarified that these transactions can affect sectoral posi-
tions; these changes are reflected through reclassifica-
tion (paragraphs 3.7–3.8; BPM5 paragraphs 485–487).
Imputed transactions are clarified and specified
(paragraph 3.18).
Changes in financial assets and liabilities due to change
in residence of individuals are treated as other changes in
the volume of assets (reclassifications) rather than as trans-
actions (paragraph 3.21; BPM5 paragraphs 352–353).
Bookkeeping conventions (vertical double-entry
bookkeeping, horizontal double-entry bookkeeping,
and quadruple-entry bookkeeping) are explained in
the context of international accounts (paragraphs 3.26–
3.29; BPM5 paragraphs 16–19).
The financial account uses the headings “net acquisi-
tion of financial assets” and “net incurrence of liabilities”
instead of “debits” and “credits” (paragraph 3.31).
The term “economic ownership” is introduced (para-
graph 3.41; BPM5 paragraph 114).
The time of recording of dividends is defined as
when the stocks or shares go ex-dividend (paragraph
3.48, also paragraph 11.31; BPM5 paragraph 121).
According to the accrual basis, repayments of debts are
recorded when they are extinguished (when they are paid,
or rescheduled, or forgiven by the creditor) rather than
when due (paragraphs 3.54–3.57; BPM5 paragraph 123).
The time of recording of flows arising from activation
of one-off guarantees is clarified (paragraph 3.58).
Definitions of domestic and foreign currencies are
provided (paragraphs 3.95–3.97).
Currency union issues related to definition of domes-
tic and foreign currency are discussed (paragraph 3.95
and Appendix 3).

Currency conversion is clarified for exchanges; con-
tinuous transactions; other flows, including revalua-
tions; and positions (paragraphs 3.104–3.105; BPM5
paragraphs 132–133).

Terms “currency of denomination” and “currency
of settlement” are introduced and their use explained
(paragraphs 3.98–3.103).

Income flows arising from reverse investment where
the direct investment enterprise owns less than 10 per-
cent of the voting power of its direct investor are also
to be recorded on a gross basis (paragraph 3.113, also
paragraph 11.97; BPM5 paragraph 276).

All capital account transactions are to be recorded on
a gross basis (paragraph 3.113; BPM5 paragraph 312).

Currency union issues related to consolidated regional
international accounts are discussed (paragraph 3.121).

Symmetry of reporting and derived measures are
dealt with explicitly (paragraphs 3.122–3.129).

Chapter 4. Economic Territory,
Units, Institutional Sectors, and
Residence
The definition of economic territory no longer has
the requirement that persons, goods, and capital circu-
late freely (paragraph 4.4; BPM5 paragraph 59).

Currency and economic unions are considered as
economic territories (paragraph 4.4 and Appendix 3).

Special zones should not be omitted but separate
data may be prepared for zones and the remainder of
the economy (paragraph 4.8).

Treatments for changes of sovereignty (paragraph
4.9) and joint administration zones (paragraph 4.10)
are provided.

A discussion of units provides a basis for links with
micro statistics and other macroeconomic statistics
(paragraphs 4.13–4.56).

The requirements for recognizing a branch as a sepa-
rate unit are amended (paragraph 4.27; BPM5 para-
graphs 75 and 80).

There is no imputed institutional unit for the
employment of staff of nonresident enterprises or

technical assistance personnel resident in the recipi-
ent economy. Therefore, technical assistance person-
nel should be treated as employed by the institutional
unit that actually employs them, which may be the
donor, a contractor, or the recipient; see paragraph
4.30 for general principles, also Box 10.6. (Previ-
ously, units may have been imputed; see BPM5 para-
graph 69.)
The treatment of notional units for land is elaborated
and its application extended to leases for long periods
(paragraphs 4.34–4.40; BPM5 paragraph 65).
Possible treatments of multiterritory enterprises are
stated (paragraphs 4.41–4.44; BPM5 paragraph 82).
The nature and treatment of special purpose entities
and other similar structures are discussed (paragraphs
4.50–4.52, 4.87, 4.93, and 4.134–4.135; BPM5 para-
graph 79).
The local enterprise group is identified and the impli-
cations of the use of different types of units are noted
(paragraphs 4.54–4.56).
The SNA institutional sector classification is adopted,
with a condensed version adopted for the standard com-
ponents (paragraph 4.59, Tables 4.1 and 4.2; BPM5
paragraphs 512–517).
The sector classification is amended to be consis-
tent with the SNA in the cases of the central bank and
deposit-taking corporations except the central bank,
although the continued use of monetary authorities is
endorsed in some cases (paragraphs 4.67–4.72; BPM5
paragraphs 514–516).
The classification of the financial sector is linked
to the treatment of debt between affiliated financial
intermediaries (paragraphs 4.63–4.90 and 6.28; BPM5
paragraph 372).
The sector classification of holding companies is
elaborated (paragraphs 4.84–4.85).
The definition of residence is expressed as “center of
predominant economic interest,” although this is not a
change in substance. The residence concept is applied to
institutional units, rather than production, ships, and so
forth (paragraph 4.113; BPM5 paragraphs 62, 78, 80–81).
Residence criteria are specified for various mobile indi-
viduals who do not spend or intend to spend a year in one
place (paragraphs 4.126–4.127; BPM5 paragraph 72).
The residence of entities with little or no physical
presence is to be determined from the jurisdiction of
Appendix 8 g Changes from BPM5
incorporation or registration (paragraphs 4.134–4.135;
BPM5 paragraph 79).

Additional guidance is provided on partner data
(paragraphs 4.146–4.164; BPM5 paragraphs 478–498).

Corporate migration is discussed (paragraphs
4.166–4.167).

Chapter 5. Classifications of
Financial Assets and Liabilities
The possibility of supplementary data on contingent
assets and liabilities is raised (paragraph 5.10).

The detailed classification of financial assets and
liabilities is harmonized with the SNA and MFSM
2000 in terms of detail and terminology (Table 5.3;
in the BPM5 standard components, instruments are
combined and different names for them are used in dif-
ferent places). These classifications are linked to broad
groups—equity, debt, and other (paragraph 5.17).

Equity may be split into listed shares, unlisted shares,
and other equity (paragraph 5.24).

Investment fund shares and money market fund shares
are separately identified (paragraphs 5.28–5.30).

SDR allocations represent a liability of the recipient
(paragraph 5.35, also paragraphs 6.61(g) and 7.70, and
applied to income in paragraphs 11.106 and 11.110;
BPM5 paragraph 440).

Interbank positions are shown as an additional
financial instrument category on a supplementary basis
(paragraph 5.42).

“Bonds and notes” and “money market instruments”
are replaced as terms by long-term and short-term debt
securities, respectively (paragraphs 5.44 and 5.103;
BPM5 paragraphs 390–391).

The conditions for traded loans to be reclassified as
securities are clarified (paragraph 5.45).

The treatment of loans involved in repos and gold
swaps is elaborated (paragraphs 5.52–5.55; BPM5 para-
graph 418).

Pension entitlements are recognized as a financial
instrument. The accrued obligations of unfunded pen-
sion schemes are also recognized as economic assets
and liabilities (paragraph 5.66).

Provisions for calls under standardized guarantees
are identified and treated similarly to insurance techni-
cal reserves (paragraph 5.68).

“Trade credit and advances” replaces the term “trade
credits” (paragraph 5.70; BPM5 paragraph 414).
Monetary gold is defined in terms of gold bul-
lion (which includes allocated gold accounts) and
unallocated gold accounts (paragraph 5.74; BPM5
paragraph 438).
The classification of unallocated and allocated gold
accounts is clarified (paragraphs 5.76–5.77).
The content of Financial Derivatives, a Supple-
ment to the Fifth Edition (1993) of the Balance of
Payments Manual (2002) is incorporated (paragraphs
5.80 –5.95).
Margin payments where these are liabilities of
deposit-taking corporations are classified as deposits
or in other accounts receivable/payable (paragraph
5.94(a)).
Supplementary additional breakdowns of financial
derivatives are introduced (paragraph 5.95).
Employee stock options are recognized as an instru-
ment (paragraphs 5.96–5.98).
Arrears are identified as a supplementary category
of the original asset or liability, rather than in repay-
ment of the original liability and the creation of a
new short-term loan (paragraphs 5.99–5.102; BPM5
paragraph 458).
Details of currency composition and remaining matu-
rity are included for selected position data in memoran-
dum and supplementary tables (paragraph 5.104, also
Appendix 9 tables; BPM5 paragraph 338).
A classification by type of interest is included (para-
graphs 5.109–5.114).
Chapter 6. Functional Categories
The Framework for Direct Investment Relationships
is adopted for identifying direct investment relation-
ships (paragraphs 6.8–6.18).
Ownership of ordinary shares is removed from the
operational definition of direct investment and replaced
by ownership of equity that gives rise to voting power
(paragraphs 6.12 and 6.19; BPM5 paragraph 362).
The coverage of direct investment relationships due
to indirect voting power and fellow enterprises is elabo-
rated (paragraph 6.14; BPM5 paragraph 362).
Insurance technical reserves are potentially included
in direct investment (paragraph 6.27).
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

The exclusion of debt positions between affili-
ated financial corporations is specified as being for
deposit-taking corporations, investment funds, and
other financial intermediaries except insurance com-
panies and pension funds. Permanent debt between
affiliated financial intermediaries is treated in the
same way as nonpermanent debt (paragraph 6.28;
BPM5 paragraph 372).

The concept of pass-through funds is introduced
(paragraphs 6.33–6.34).

Direct investment is broken down into three cate-
gories—investment by a direct investor in its direct
investment enterprise, reverse investment, and invest-
ment between fellow enterprises; the final category
is added in this edition (paragraph 6.37; BPM5 para-
graphs 368 and 371).

The main presentation uses direct investment assets
and direct investment liabilities (so that, for example,
the netting of reverse investment is not built in). How-
ever, data on the basis of the directional principle are
explained (paragraphs 6.42–6.45 and Box 6.4; BPM5
paragraph 375). The treatment of fellow enterprises
in data on a directional basis is explained, with both
a preferred and practical alternative suggested (para-
graph 6.43). Data on a directional principle basis and
the details needed to compile these data are shown as
supplementary items in Appendix 9.

The functional category “financial derivatives” is
renamed. “(Other than reserves)” is added to distin-
guish it from the instrument classification financial
derivatives and employee stock options, which has
different coverage. Employee stock options are also
included (paragraph 6.58).

The content of the Financial Derivatives, a Supple-
ment to the Fifth Edition (1993) of the Balance of
Payments Manual (2002) is incorporated (paragraphs
6.58–6.60).

SDR allocation liabilities are included in other invest-
ment as a separate item; previously, no liabilities were
recognized (paragraph 6.61(g), also paragraphs 5.35
and 7.70; BPM5 paragraph 440).

Other equity not included in direct investment is
included in other investment as a separate item (para-
graph 6.62; BPM5 paragraph 422).

In the definition of reserve assets, “and/or other pur-
poses” replaced by “and for other related purposes”
(paragraph 6.64; BPM5 paragraph 424).

The concept of ready availability is clarified (para-
graphs 6.69–6.70; BPM5 paragraph 431).
The meaning of foreign currency for reserve assets
is elaborated (paragraphs 6.71–6.75; BPM5 paragraph
442). Convertibility (including treatment of curren-
cies of neighboring countries) is clarified (paragraphs
6.72–6.73).
The treatments of allocated and unallocated gold
accounts in reserve assets, and changes in the coverage of
monetary gold, are elaborated (paragraphs 6.78–6.80).
The treatments of gold lending (paragraph 6.81;
BPM5 paragraph 434), repos (paragraph 6.88), special-
purpose government funds (paragraphs 6.93–6.98),
pooled assets (paragraphs 6.99–6.101), central bank
swap arrangements (paragraphs 6.102–6.104), and
pledged assets (paragraphs 6.107–6.109) in reserve
assets are elaborated.
Frozen assets are discussed (paragraph 6.110).
The treatment of net creditor positions in regional
payment agreements is modified (paragraph 6.112).
Working balances of government agencies are not
included in reserve assets (paragraph 6.112; BPM5
paragraph 433).
Reserve-related liabilities are introduced as a clas-
sification (paragraphs 6.115–6.116).
Liabilities constituting foreign authorities’ reserves
are not shown as separate items ( BPM5 paragraph 447).
Chapter 7. International Investment
Position
There is emphasis that the classification, netting, and
ordering in the IIP should be consistent with the equiv-
alent items for the financial account, primary income,
and other changes so as to facilitate reconciliation and
calculation of rates of return (paragraph 7.13; also para-
graph 8.5).
The main presentation uses direct investment
assets and direct investment liabilities (so that reverse
investment is not netted in totals) (Table 7.1; BPM5
paragraph 375).
Direct investment is valued at the best indicator of
market prices. ( BPM5 adopted market valuation in
principle, while noting that book values “generally are
utilized” in practice.) For equity that is not regularly
Appendix 8 g Changes from BPM5
traded, proxy methods are identified for when book
values are inadequate and the limitations in the ana-
lytical usefulness of historic cost data are emphasized
(paragraphs 7.15–7.18; BPM5 paragraph 467).

A treatment for short positions is provided (para-
graph 7.28).

Traded loans are valued at nominal value in the IIP,
like other loans; in BPM5 , they were recorded at trans-
action value by the creditor (paragraph 7.40; BPM5
paragraph 471).

Memorandum and supplementary items for the effect
of impaired loan assets are introduced, showing fair
values of loans, the values of nonperforming loans, and
loan loss provisions (paragraphs 7.45–7.54).

The treatment of overnight deposits (or sweep
accounts) is discussed (paragraph 7.62).

Insurance reserves and pension entitlements are
recognized as assets and liabilities (paragraphs 7.63–
7.68 ).

SDR allocations are recognized as liabilities (para-
graph 7.70, also paragraphs 5.35 and 6.61(g); BPM5
paragraph 440).

Reserve-related liabilities are introduced as a memo-
randum item (paragraph 7.71).

Significant off-balance-sheet commitments should
be recorded (paragraph 7.74).

Guidance on transactions and positions with the IMF
is provided (Annex 7.1).

Chapter 8. Financial Account
The column headings are changed to net acquisi-
tions of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities
(instead of credits and debits, respectively) consistent
with their contents. Consequently, negative signs are
not used for an increase in assets and positive signs are
not used for a reduction in assets (paragraph 8.1, Table
8.1, also paragraph 3.31).

Financial account entries no longer use the word
“capital,” bringing consistency with the more restrictive
meaning used in the capital account (Table 8.1).

The balancing item for the financial account is called
“net lending/net borrowing” (paragraph 8.3).

The terminology for the financial account entry is
changed to “reinvestment of earnings” (to distinguish

it from reinvested earnings, which continues to be used
for the corresponding income item) (paragraph 8.15).
Mergers and acquisitions are discussed (paragraph
8.18).
The treatment for corporate inversion and other
corporate restructuring is stated (paragraphs 8.19–
8.22).
Superdividends are treated as a withdrawal of equity
(paragraph 8.23; BPM5 paragraph 290).
Special rules are introduced for entities owned or
controlled by general government when that entity is
resident in another territory and is used for fiscal pur-
poses (paragraphs 8.24–8.26).
Reinvestment of earnings in investment funds is
recorded in the financial account (paragraph 8.28 and
also paragraphs 11.37–11.39 for the corresponding
income entry; BPM5 paragraphs 277–278).
The treatment of debt defeasance is stated (para-
graphs 8.30–8.31).
The treatment of share buybacks is stated (paragraph
8.32).
A treatment of one-off guarantees and debt assump-
tion is included (paragraphs 8.42–8.45).
The allocation of SDRs is shown as a financial
account flow in other investment (paragraph 8.50;
BPM5 paragraph 440).
For liabilities in arrears, repayment and creation of
new liability are not imputed (paragraph 8.58; BPM5
paragraph 458).
Imputed financial account entries for trade credit
required by the imputed flows for goods for process-
ing are eliminated (as an implication of removing the
previous imputation of change of ownership; new treat-
ments shown in paragraphs 10.41–10.49; BPM5 para-
graph 205).
Chapter 9. Other Changes in Financial
Assets and Liabilities Account
The other changes in financial assets and liabili-
ties account is highlighted and explained (paragraphs
9.1–9.35).
A convention for distinction between write-offs and
debt forgiveness in commercial situations is introduced
(paragraph 9.10; BPM5 paragraph 348).
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Financial assets and liabilities of entities chang-
ing residence are included as other changes in volume
(previously included as capital transfers) (paragraphs
9.21–9.23; BPM5 paragraphs 354–355).

The distinction between exchange rate and other
revaluations is elaborated (paragraphs 9.26–9.28;
BPM5 paragraph 466).

Chapter 10. Goods and Services
Account
Exceptions to the change of ownership principle are
eliminated (paragraphs 10.13, 10.22(b), 10.22(f), 10.24,
10.41–10.44; BPM5 paragraphs 119–120).

Goods procured in ports by carriers are included
under general merchandise rather than as a separate
item under goods (paragraph 10.17(d); BPM5 para-
graphs 156 and 201).

Goods for own use or to give away acquired by travel-
ers that are in excess of customs thresholds are included
in general merchandise, rather than travel (paragraphs
10.20 and 10.90; BPM5 paragraph 242).

Migrants’ personal effects are not included in gen-
eral merchandise or anywhere else in the international
accounts (paragraph 10.22(b); BPM5 paragraph 353).

The time of recording of transactions in high-value
capital goods such as ships, heavy machinery, build-
ings, and other structures that take several months or
years to complete is discussed (paragraph 10.28).

Re-exports are defined and introduced as a supple-
mentary item (paragraphs 10.37–10.39).

Merchanting of goods is classified under goods, with
both gross and net values shown, with net amounts
included in the goods aggregates. Changes in invento-
ries of goods under merchanting are no longer included
under imports of general merchandise (paragraphs
10.41–10.49; BPM5 paragraph 262).

A reconciliation table is introduced to show the
relationship between international merchandise trade
statistics and goods on a balance of payments basis
(paragraphs 10.55–10.56, Table 10.2).

Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned
by others are shown as a service in all cases. Previ-
ously, when the goods were supplied from the owner
and returned to the owner, the value of the service
was included in the value of goods. Previously,
when the goods were not supplied by the owner or

not returned to the owner, they were shown under
miscellaneous business, professional, and technical
services (paragraphs 10.62–10.71; BPM5 paragraphs
198–199).
Maintenance and repair services n.i.e. are renamed in
line with the CPC and included under services, rather
than goods, and the inclusion of maintenance of trans-
port equipment is clarified (paragraphs 10.72–10.73;
BPM5 paragraphs 200 and 240).
Transport services are renamed (previously “trans-
portation services”) in line with the CPC (paragraph
10.74; BPM5 paragraph 230).
Postal and courier services are included in transport
(paragraphs 10.82–10.85; BPM5 paragraph 253).
Treatments of alternative time-share arrangements
are stated (paragraph 10.100 and Table 10.3).
The classification of acquisition of goods and ser-
vices by nonresident construction enterprises in the
economy in which they are working is changed to show
separately construction abroad and construction in the
compiling economy on a supplementary basis. Goods
and services acquired locally are included under this
heading, previously under other business services. The
inclusion of buildings (excluding the land component)
is clarified as being under construction. As a result
of these changes, the title of the item is construction,
rather than construction services (paragraphs 10.101–
10.108, BPM5 paragraph 254).
The estimate of insurance claims used to derive the
value of insurance services is changed to adjust for
claim volatility. Premium supplements are taken into
account in deriving insurance services. Reinsurance
and direct insurance are treated consistently (paragraph
10.111; BPM5 paragraph 257).
Financial dealers’ margins are discussed under ser-
vices (previously only mentioned in the discussion
of the financial account) (paragraphs 10.122–10.123;
BPM5 paragraph 106).
Services of asset-holding entities to their owners,
where asset management costs are taken out of income,
are recognized (paragraphs 10.124–10.125).
FISIM and other implicit financial services have
been included in services, with a method for calculation
based on the reference rate (paragraphs 10.126–10.136;
footnote to BPM5 paragraph 258).
“Charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e.”
replaces the term “royalties and license fees.” Also, its
Appendix 8 g Changes from BPM5
content and borderlines with computing and audiovisual
services have been clarified (paragraphs 10.137–10.140
and Table 10.4; BPM5 paragraph 260).

A grouping of telecommunications, computer, and
information services is introduced, involving a number
of items that had previously been separated (paragraph
10.141; BPM5 paragraphs 253 and 259).

The borderline between goods and services is elab-
orated for computer software (paragraph 10.143 and
Table 10.4; BPM5 paragraphs 259–260).

The results of research and development (such as pat-
ents, copyrights, and industrial processes) are treated as
produced assets included in research and development
services (previously treated as nonproduced assets and
shown in the capital account) (paragraph 10.148; BPM5
paragraph 358).

Environmental services such as carbon offsets and
sequestration, waste treatment, and handling of scrap
are discussed (paragraph 10.152, also 10.22(h)).

Merchanting of services is described and its treat-
ment explained (paragraph 10.160).

Audiovisual services are delineated from goods, and
the relationship between different kinds of licenses for
intellectual property is explained (paragraphs 10.162–
10.166 and Table 10.4; BPM5 paragraph 265).

The treatment of gambling services is described
(paragraph 10.171, also 12.25).

The coverage of government goods and services
n.i.e. is clarified (paragraphs 10.173–10.181; BPM5
paragraph 266).

A discussion of the treatment of government licenses,
permits, and so forth is provided (paragraphs 10.180–
10.181; BPM5 paragraph 300).

Additional guidance on the treatment of technical
assistance is provided (Box 10.6).

Chapter 11. Primary Income Account
The term “primary income” is introduced. Con-
sistency between international accounts and national
accounts is ensured. The meaning and relationship
of primary income, property income, and investment
income are clarified (paragraphs 11.1–11.3; BPM5
paragraph 267).

A detailed breakdown of investment income is intro-
duced to link with functional and instrument classi-

fications of financial instruments. Income on other
investment and income on reserve assets are shown
separately. Rent and taxes and subsidies on products
and production are included explicitly as primary
income items (Tables 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3; BPM5 para-
graph 281).
The employer-employee relationship is clarified to
distinguish between compensation of employees and
payments for services (paragraphs 11.11–11.13).
“Distributed income from quasi-corporations” as a
term subsumes distributed branch profits (paragraph
11.26; BPM5 paragraph 277).
Superdividends are defined and their treatment as
withdrawals of equity extended (paragraph 11.27; lim-
ited to liquidating dividends in BPM5 paragraph 290).
Dividends are recorded at the time the shares go ex
dividend (paragraph 11.31, also paragraph 3.48; BPM5
paragraph 282).
“Reinvested earnings” is used as a term for all
direct investment enterprises, and thus includes undis-
tributed branch profits (paragraph 11.35; BPM5 para-
graph 277).
Investment income attributable to the owners
of investment fund shares also includes reinvested
earnings (paragraphs 11.37–11.39; BPM5 paragraphs
277–278).
If branches do not distribute profits, the retained
earnings of the branch are considered to be reinvested
earnings. In BPM5 , if distributed branch profits were
not identified, all branch profits were treated as being
distributed, not reinvested earnings (paragraph 11.42;
BPM5 paragraph 278).
When a chain of direct investment relationships exists,
it is clarified that reinvested earnings should be recorded
between the direct investor and directly owned direct
investment enterprises only (paragraph 11.47).
Debt instruments with both the amount to be paid
at maturity and periodic payments indexed to a for-
eign currency are classified and treated as if they are
denominated in foreign currency (paragraph 11.50(a) –
(b); BPM5 paragraph 397).
The treatment of index-linked debt instruments is
clarified and modified (paragraphs 11.50(c) and 11.59–
11.65; BPM5 paragraph 397).
Fees on securities lending and gold loans are clari-
fied and treated as interest (paragraphs 11.67–11.68).
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION MANUAL

Interest income is adjusted to remove the FISIM
component, that is, “pure interest.” “Actual interest” is
continued as a memorandum item (paragraphs 11.74–
11.75; fo ot not e to BPM5 paragraph 258).

Rent is identified as a component of primary income
(paragraph 11.85; previously part of other investment
income).

Taxes and subsidies on products and production are
classed as primary income, not current transfers (para-
g r aphs 11.91–11.92 ; BPM5 paragraph 299).

Treatments of income on reverse investment and
investment between fellow enterprises are included.
Income arising from reverse investment is to be recorded
on a gross, rather than net, basis. Possible breakdowns
by type of direct investment relationship and associated
investment income flows are distinguished (paragraphs
11.97–11.10 0 ; BPM5 paragraph 276).

The treatment of transfer pricing is clarified (para-
graphs 11.101–11.102; BPM5 paragraph 97).

Income on reserve assets is identified separately
(previously other investment) (paragraph 11.109; BPM5
paragraph 281).

Consistent with the corresponding positions, interest
on SDR allocations and holdings are shown on a gross
basis (paragraph 11.110).

Chapter 12. Secondary Income
Account
The term “secondary income” is introduced (para-
graph 12.1; BPM5 paragraph 291).

More detailed classification of types of current trans-
fers are introduced on a supplementary basis (para-
graphs 12.20–12.58).

Refunds of taxes to taxpayers are treated as nega-
tive taxes, that is, the amount of taxes is reduced by
tax refunds instead of positive transfers by government
(paragraph 12.28; BPM5 paragraph 299).

The delineation between taxes and services is clari-
fied. Business licenses to fish, hunt, and so forth are no
longer automatically treated as taxes, but as services,
rent, taxes, or acquisition of a license asset, depending
on what is supplied in return (paragraph 12.30, also
10.180 –10.181; BPM5 paragraph 300).

The treatment of social contributions and benefits is
specified (paragraphs 12.32–12.40).

The treatment of pension contributions and benefits
is aligned with the SNA and the adjustment for change
in pension entitlements is introduced (paragraph 12.39;
BPM5 paragraph 299).
The treatment of insurance claims and net premiums
and of standardized guarantees is specified (paragraphs
12.41–12.46; BPM5 paragraph 257).
Clarification is made on technical assistance as a
part of investment projects to be classified as capital
transfers (paragraph 12.50).
Concessional debt is discussed and introduced as
a supplementary item. In BPM5 , a transfer could be
identified on government loans bearing lower interest
rates than those consistent with grace and repayment
periods, although the implementation of this principle
was not elaborated (paragraph 12.51; BPM5 paragraph
104).
The term “personal transfers,” which is broader than
workers’ remittances, is introduced (paragraph 12.21;
BPM5 paragraph 302).
The concepts of (1) personal remittances, (2) total
remittances, and (3) total remittances and transfers to
NPISHs are introduced (paragraph 12.27).
The treatment of gambling transfers is described
(paragraph 12.26).
Chapter 13. Capital Account
Debits and credits for acquisitions and disposals of
nonproduced nonfinancial assets are to be recorded
separately, not netted (paragraph 13.7, also paragraph
3.113; BPM5 paragraph 312).
The terminology for nonproduced assets is expanded,
to include “natural resources,” “contracts, leases, and
licenses,” and “marketing assets and goodwill” (para-
graphs 13.8–13.18; BPM5 paragraph 358).
Internet domain names are identified as possible eco-
nomic assets (paragraph 13.18).
Insurance claims may be treated as capital transfers
in the case of catastrophes (paragraph 13.24; BPM5
paragraph 257).
The personal effects, financial assets, and liabilities
of persons changing residence are no longer covered by
a capital transfer (paragraph 13.30, also 9.21–9.22 and
10.22 (b); BPM5 paragraphs 352–353).
Appendix 8 g Changes from BPM5
Inheritance is treated as a capital transfer instead
of a current transfer (paragraph 13.31; BPM5 para-
graph 303).

Patents and copyrights are no longer treated as non-
produced assets, so no longer appear in the capital
account. (Patents and copyrights are classified as pro-
duced assets and appear under particular services, such
as research and development services; see Table 10.4.)
( BPM5 paragraph 358).

Chapter 14. Selected Issues in Balance
of Payments and International
Investment Position Analysis
The “analytic” presentation (paragraphs 14.16–14.17),
monetary presentation (paragraphs 14.20–14.22),
implications of a current account surplus (paragraphs
14.48–14.56), and balance sheet approach (paragraphs
14.57–14.66) are incorporated ( BPM5 Appendix V).

(^1) Data for RRL are to be presented on a remaining maturity basis.
(^2) The inclusion of a repo loan within RRL depends on the treatment of repo transactions within reserves. If the security stays in reserve assets, the repo loan
is recorded as a liability within RRL. Otherwise the repo loan is excluded from RRL.
(^3) For comprehensiveness, this listing of supplementary items incorporates the memorandum items for short-term liabilities (2.2.). See paragraph 6.115 for
further information.
(^4) Data for RRL, other foreign currency assets and liabilities are to be presented on a remaining maturity basis.
(^5) The inclusion of a repo loan within RRL depends on the treatment of repo transactions within reserves. If the security stays in reserve assets, the repo loan
is recorded as a liability within RRL. If the security is reclassified to portfolio investment, the asset and the repo loan liability are included under other foreign
currency asset and other foreign currency liabilities respectively.
(^6) Other foreign currency assets and liabilities includes claims and liabilities of the monetary authorities and central government to both residentsand non-
residents, other than those covered in reserve assets and RRL to nonresidents.This approach for other foreign currency assets and liabilities is consistent with
the approach in Sections 1.B and 2 of the Reserves Template. To support reconciliation with government finance statistics, a subsector split between central
government and the central bank could be included.
(^7) This item would include any net financial derivative positions of the central government and of the monetary authorities not included in reserve assets
nor RRL.
